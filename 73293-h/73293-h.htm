<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CHOICE_OF_THE_PRINCESS">THE CHOICE OF THE PRINCESS</h2>
</div>


<p>A beautiful princess lived in Inaba. She was called
the Princess of Yakami, and was the loveliest princess
in all the land. Her skin was like velvet, her hair was
dark as night, and her eyes were as bright and soft as
the stars. She was sweet as well as fair, but willful,
and when they said, “Fair Princess, you must marry,”
she replied, “The time has not yet come. I see nowhere
in Inaba the man who may be my lord.”</p>

<p>At this the court was in despair. The Princess would
not marry until she was quite ready,—that the counselors
knew. They had not counseled the little, pretty,
willful princess for nothing. Had the king, her father,
lived it might have been different; but he was
long since gone, and the queen mother could do no
more with the princess than could the wise men of the
kingdom. Early in her life the princess had learned
that there was just one thing she could say which no
one could answer. She had only to look very sweetly
at whoever was trying to persuade her to do something,
and then, with a dainty little smile, say simply, “But
I don’t want to!”</p>

<p>That was all. No one, not even the wisest of the
counselors, had ever found an answer to that. It was
a strange state of affairs; for all the little princesses
before had been gentle and sweet, and had done just
what they were told.</p>

<p>The counselors at length proclaimed that all young
men of proper age and rank should present themselves
for the princess to look at and see if she liked any of
them well enough to marry.</p>

<p>The news of this quickly spread everywhere. It was
no time at all before the road to <span class="cor" title="Source: Yakima" id="cor10">Yakami</span> was seen
crowded with youths. There were youths tall and short,
fat and thin, handsome and ugly, and each hoped he
would be the favored suitor.</p>

<p>Among others there came eighty-one brothers, each
of whom had seen the picture of the princess and wished
to win her. These brothers were of noble family, but
the youngest was the only one who was really noble.
He was as brave as Yositumé! Eighty of the brothers
were ugly and jealous of one another. It seemed as if
they could agree upon nothing in all the world except
treating the youngest meanly. They despised him because
he was so good and gentle, and never rude or
quarrelsome.</p>

<p>The eighty-first brother never complained. He
tried to please his brothers; and when he found that
he could not, he stayed away from them as far as
possible.</p>

<p>When, therefore, they went to wait on the princess,
he lingered at the back of the train; for his brothers
scoffed at him and made him carry their burdens, as
if he had been a servant.</p>

<p>The eighty brothers went proudly ahead. As they
toiled up a mountain-side they came upon a poor little
hare stretched out upon the grass. All his fur had been
pulled out and he was ill and wretched.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you what will cure you,” said one of
the brothers, with a wicked laugh to his companions.
“Go down to the sea; bathe yourself in the salt water,
and then run to the top of the hill. The Wind God
of the hilltop will cure you, and your fur will grow
again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, noble prince,” said the hare; and as
the eighty brothers turned away laughing, he hurried
to the sea shore.</p>

<p>Alas! the salt water hurt his tender skin, and the sun
and wind burned him so that he cried out with pain.</p>

<p>The eighty-first brother, trudging along with his
brothers’ bundles, heard the cry and hurried to see if
some one was hurt.</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow!” he said, pityingly. “What is
the matter?”</p>

<p>“Your voice is kind, your face is kind, and I feel
that you have a kind heart,” said the hare. “Perhaps
you can help me if I tell you my story.”</p>

<p>“I will gladly do so if I can,” said the eighty-first
brother.</p>

<p>“I was born in the Isle of Oki,” said the hare.
“When I grew up I longed to see the world, but I knew
not how to reach the mainland. After a long time,
however, I thought of a way. Great numbers of crocodiles
were in the habit of coming to the beach to sun
themselves. One day I said to them boastfully, ‘There
are more hares in Oki than crocodiles in the sea.’</p>

<p>“‘Not so,’ said one of the crocodiles, ‘there are a
great many more crocodiles.’</p>

<p>“‘Let us count,’ I answered, ‘and then both will be
satisfied. I can count all of you crocodiles very easily.
You have only to form a line from here to Cape Kita,
and let the nose of one be at the tail of another, and I
will run lightly across on your backs and count as I go.
Then we shall know how many crocodiles there are.’</p>

<p>“‘But how shall we know about the hares?’ asked a
crocodile.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, that we can decide later,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“So they did as I had said. They formed in a line,
and I ran across. Their broad backs made a good
bridge, but, alas, why did I not know enough to hold
my tongue? As I jumped from the last crocodile to
the bank, I cried, ‘I have fooled you well! I don’t care
how many crocodiles there are. I only used you as a
bridge to reach the mainland.’ But just as I said this,
the last monster grabbed me with his teeth and tore off
all my fur.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>“‘You deserve to be killed,’ he said. ‘But I will let
you go. In future do not try to deceive creatures bigger
than yourself.’”</p>

<p>“Indeed, he was quite right,” said the eighty-first
brother. “You were well paid for being deceitful; but
I am very sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“Let me finish my story,” said the hare, hanging his
head at this rebuke. “As I lay here, smarting with
pain, a train of princes passed by. One of them told
me to bathe in the sea and run in the wind. I did so,
and that is what put me in this painful state. Now
what can I do, for I can hardly bear my suffering?”</p>

<p>“It must have been my eighty brothers whom you
met,” said the prince. “I must try to help you, since
they have been so cruel. Go and bathe in the fresh
water of the river. Then take pollen from the reeds and
rub yourself with it. Your skin will heal, and your fur
will grow again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, most noble prince,” cried the hare.
“You are as good as your eighty brothers are evil. You
will find that I am not ungrateful,” and he hastened to
the river.</p>

<p>Soon he felt quite well; and he hurried away, scarcely
waiting to bid the prince good-by.</p>

<p>The eighty-first brother smiled to himself as he
thought, “He is not so grateful as he pretended.”
Then he went on to the court.</p>

<p>The hare, however, was already there. He had heard
the talk about the wedding of the princess, and he saw
how he could serve the one who had been kind to him.</p>

<p>One of the hare’s brothers was a handsome little fellow
who had been given to the princess and who was a
great favorite at the court. So the hare of Inaba hurried
to this brother and told him his story.</p>

<p>“Now, to help my prince to wed your princess,”
he said. “Two such kind souls should dwell together
and make the world happier.”</p>

<p>“Trust me,” said his brother, who had grown wise
since he came to the palace and had learned court ways.</p>

<p>So when the eighty brothers presented themselves
before the princess, dressed all in their finest array,
she received them scornfully and sent them all away.</p>

<p>“Your faces smile,” she said, “but your hearts are
cruel, and I will have none of you.”</p>

<p>But when the eighty-first brother presented himself
before her golden throne, she stretched forth her hand
and said, “Good heart and true, I will share my throne
with you and you alone!”</p>

<p>Then was the eighty-first brother glad; and all the
people rejoiced and the little hare danced merrily on
two legs and said, “You see now, dear Prince, that I
am not ungrateful; for it is due to me that you are the
Choice of the Princess.”</p>

</div>


<p>Many, many years ago, when the gods reigned in
high heaven, the country of Nippon rose from the
waters. Izanagi and Izananu, standing upon the floating
bridge of heaven, thrust down a glittering blade.
They probed the blue ocean and the drops from the
sword’s point hardened and became islands; and thus
was created the “Land of Many Blades,” the isles of
Nippon.</p>

<p>Now Izanagi and Izananu were the highest of the
gods of heaven, and they had two children, Amaterasu
and Susanoo. Susanoo was made god of the sea, and
his sister was the bright and beautiful sun goddess,
whose name meant Great Goddess of the Shining
Heaven.</p>

<p>She reigned happily from her bright golden throne
for many years, but Susanoo, like many other brothers,
was a tease, and he made his sister very angry with
some of his tricks. She was quite patient with him,
as elder sisters should be, but at last there came a time
when she could no longer stand his naughty ways.</p>

<p>Amaterasu sent Susanoo one day upon an errand,
for she wished him to find a goddess named Uke-mochi,
who lived in the reedy moors. When Susanoo found her
he was tired and hungry, and so he asked her for food.
Uke-mochi took food from her mouth to give him and
this made him very angry. “Why feed me with foul
things? You shall not live!” he cried; and, drawing
his sword, he struck her dead.</p>

<p>When he went home and told Amaterasu what he
had done, his sister was in a great rage and left her
brother in total darkness. She fled to the cave of Ameno
and closed the entrance with a huge rock. Then was
all the earth dark, for the sun goddess no longer shed
her light upon men. So terrible was it upon earth
that at last the other gods met together near the cave,
to consult and see what could be done.</p>

<p>They tried in every way to persuade Amaterasu to
come forth, but she sulked like a naughty child and
would not shine upon them. At last they thought of
a plan to entice the goddess from her cavern by means
of an image of herself. So a mirror was made, very
large and fine. It was hung upon a tree, just before the
door of the cave, and a strong hempen cord was put
in the hands of a god who hid himself beside the door.</p>

<p>A number of cocks were started to crowing, and the
lovely goddess Uzumé began to dance to music from
a bamboo tube. The gods kept time by striking two
pieces of wood together, and one of them played a
harp made by placing six of their bows together with
the strings upward and drawing grass and rushes across
them. Great bonfires were lighted, and a huge drum
was brought for Uzumé to dance upon. This she did
with so much spirit and grace that all the gods were
delighted. They laughed with joy, clapped their hands,
and fairly shook high heaven with their merriment.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Amaterasu heard the noise and could not understand
it. She was annoyed because the gods seemed to be
having such a good time without her. She had thought
that they could not possibly get along unless she let
the light of her face shine upon them. She was naturally
very curious to find out what it was all about. So she
pushed open the door of her cave, just a little bit, and
peeped out. There, by the light of the bonfires she saw
Uzumé’s graceful dancing, and heard her sing,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Why does Uzumé dance and why do the gods laugh?
I thought both heaven and earth would be sad without
me”, said Amaterasu crossly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed Uzumé. “We rejoice because
we have here a deity who far surpasses you in beauty.”</p>

<p>“Where?” demanded the sun goddess indignantly.
“Let me see her!” and as she spoke she caught sight
of her own reflection in the mirror.</p>

<p>She had never seen such a thing before and was
greatly astonished. She stepped outside her cave to
see more plainly this radiant rival, when lo! the god
who was waiting, seized her and drew her forth, quickly
passing the rope across the cave door to prevent her
return. Thus was the sun goddess restored to earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SWORDED_FALCON">THE SWORDED FALCON</h2>
</div>


<p>In the days of the Emperor Koan there lived near
Koya a falcon which had wings and a tail of swords.
It was far more dreaded than a porcupine of even
the largest spines, and it used to lie in wait near
the village of Koya to carry off people and eat
them.</p>

<p>No one was safe from the ferocious bird. Little
people, playing beneath the pines, happy in childish
glee, were but tender morsels for the cruel bird. Women
resting under the long <span class="cor" title="Source: racimes" id="cor94">racemes</span> of the woodland wistaria,
were attacked and dragged screaming to his nest.
Even the men working in the rice fields would sometimes
hear a cry of agony and see one of their number
suddenly rise into the air in the clutches of the monstrous
bird.</p>

<p>The villagers despaired of ever being able to rid themselves
of this terrible creature. At last they sent a petition
to the Mikado, urging him to send some one to
deliver them from the pest.</p>

<p>“Behold!” they cried, “We, the subjects of Your
Majesty, are in much fear and danger from this fierce
creature, and we beseech you to save us, your humble
servants.”</p>

<p>The Mikado sent to their aid the brave Prince
Yashimasa; and the Prince tarried long in the village,
for the bird was very wary and hid from sight. When
the Prince went out to seek him, the falcon would disguise
himself in various shapes. First, he would appear
as a woman washing clothes beside the river; then he
would become a tree growing beside a rippling waterfall;
and again, he would look like a crane standing on the
reedy shore.</p>

<p>It took so long to find the creature that Prince
Yashimasa tarried for months in the house of Atago
Shoji, a gentleman of the town. Thus it came about
that he loved Atago’s daughter, the fair and gentle
Shiragika, and the maiden returned his love. The
two walked happily together in the iris-bordered meadows,
and chatted long and cheerfully in the shade of
the bamboo trees.</p>

<p>One day Prince Yashimasa found the nest of the
falcon upon a hilltop and he cried, “Aha! my fine
fellow! At last I have you! Soon I shall destroy you,
and the village will no longer be in dread, but will rejoice
greatly.”</p>

<p>He hid himself in a bamboo thicket, armed with his
bow and arrows, and awaited the coming of the falcon.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“HE SENT HIS ARROW THROUGH ITS CRUEL HEART”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>At last it came, fierce and terrible. Its eyes gleamed
like twin stars, its tail spread like forked lightning, its
wings of gleaming steel beat the air like flames of fire!</p>

<p>“It is indeed the sworded falcon,” said Yashimasa,
and, aiming carefully, he sent his arrow through its
cruel heart. The falcon dropped dead, and Yashimasa
hurried to the village to tell the news.</p>

<p>Then all the people rejoiced, singing the victor’s
praises. “Hail to the noble prince!” they cried. “He
has delivered us from the evil claws and the cruel beak
of this demon-bird! Greatly will our lord the Mikado
reward him.”</p>

<p>But Shiragika wept and mourned, for now that her
lover’s task was done, she knew that he must return to
his home. He must go alone, for it was not fitting
that she, a simple village maiden, should go with him
to the Emperor’s court.</p>

<p>“Yashimasa,” she wept. “Farewell forever. Forget
me and be happy!”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Yashimasa. “As soon as I have
told the Mikado of the success of my mission I will
return to find you. Never will I forget you;” and he
bade her a tender farewell.</p>

<p>She waited long and looked for his return, but he
came not, for the Mikado sent him on other missions
to far lands and he must obey. At last, with her kimono
sleeves loaded with stones, she dropped gently to sleep
in the great river. And as she sank to rest, she sighed,
“Yashimasa! In its death, the sworded falcon pierced
my heart!”</p>

<p>When Yashimasa heard of her death, he mourned
her truly; and when he grew old he returned to Koya
and died beside the stream where she had perished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PHANTOM_CATS">THE PHANTOM CATS</h2>
</div>


<p>A ruined temple stood in a lonely wood. All about
it was a trackless forest. The huge trees waved above
it, the leaves in the thicket whispered about it, the sun
goddess seldom shone upon it with her light.</p>

<p>Uguisu,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> poet of the woods, sang in the plum tree near
by. He sang the poet’s song to the plum tree which he
loved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Send forth your fragrance upon the eastern winds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh flower of the plum tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forget not the spring because of the absence of the sun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ruined though the temple was, it still held a shrine
and hither came Wakiki Mononofu, a young <span class="cor" title="Source: samurai" id="cor27">Samurai</span>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
He was a brave young soldier who was seeking his fortune
in the wide, wide world. He had lost his way and
wandered in the forest seeking the path, until at length
he came to the little clear space where was the temple.
A storm was coming up, and a palace could not have
seemed more welcome to the young warrior.</p>

<p>“Here is all I want,” he said to himself. “Here I
shall have a shelter from the storm god’s wrath, and a
place to sleep and dream of glory and adventure. What
more could be desired?”</p>

<p>Then he wrapped himself in his mantle, curled up
in a corner of the sacred room, and soon fell asleep.
But his slumber did not last long. His pleasant dreams
were disturbed by horrid sounds, and waking, he sprang
to his feet and looked out of the temple door.</p>

<p>There he saw a troop of monstrous cats which seemed
in the weird moonlight like phantoms, marching across
the clear space in front of the temple, and dancing a
wild dance. As they danced they uttered horrid sounds,
yells, and wicked laughs; and through these he could
hear the words of a strange chant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Whisper not to Shippeitaro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the Phantom Cats are near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whisper not to Shippeitaro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest he soon appear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wakiki crouched low behind the door; for, brave
as he was, there was something so dreadful in the appearance
of the creatures that he did not want them to
see him. Soon, however, with a chorus of wild yells,
they disappeared as quickly as they had come. Then
Wakiki lay down and slept again, nor did he waken
until the sun goddess peered into the temple and
whispered to him that it was morning.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>By the morning light it was easy to find the path
which the night’s shadows had hidden from him, and
being very hungry he started out to seek some dwelling.
The path led away from the temple, in an opposite
direction to that from which he had come the night
before. Soon, however, he came out of the forest and
saw a little hamlet surrounded by green fields.</p>

<p>“How fortunate I am,” he cried joyfully. “Here are
houses, and so there must be people, and people must
have something to eat. If they are kind they will share
with me, and I am starving for a bowl of rice.”</p>

<p>He hurried to the nearest cottage, but as he approached
he heard sounds of bitter weeping. He went
up to the door, and was met by a sweet young girl whose
eyes were red with crying. She greeted him kindly,
and he asked her for food.</p>

<p>“Enter and welcome,” said she. “My parents are
about to be served with breakfast. You shall join
them, for no one must pass our door hungry.”</p>

<p>Thanking her the young warrior went in and seated
himself upon the floor. The parents of the young girl
greeted him courteously. A small table was set before
him, and on it was placed rice and tea. He ate heartily,
and, when he had finished eating, rose to go.</p>

<p>“Thank you very many times for such a good meal,
kind friends,” he said.</p>

<p>“You have been welcome. Go in peace,” said the
master of the house.</p>

<p>“And may happiness be yours,” returned the young
Samurai.</p>

<p>“Happiness can never again be ours,” said the old
man, with a sad face, as his daughter left the room.
Her mother followed her and from behind the paper
partitions of the breakfast room, Wakiki could hear
sounds as if she were trying to comfort the young
girl.</p>

<p>“You are then in trouble?” he asked, not liking to
be inquisitive, and yet wishing to show sympathy.</p>

<p>“Terrible trouble,” said the father. “There is no
help! Know, gentle Samurai, that there is within the
forest a ruined temple. This shrine, once the home of
sacred things, is now the abode of horrors too terrible
for words. Each year a mountain spirit, a demon whom
no one has ever seen, demands from us a victim, upon
pain of destroying the whole village. The victim is
placed in a cage and carried to the temple just at sunset.
There she is left and no one knows what is her
fate, for in the morning not a trace of her remains. It
must always be the fairest maiden of the village who
is offered up and this year, alas, it is my daughter’s
turn;” and the old man buried his face in his hands
and groaned.</p>

<p>“I should think this strange thing would make the
young girls of your village far from vain and each
would wish to be the ugliest,” said the young warrior.
“It is terrible indeed, but do not despair. I am sure I
shall find a way to help you.” He paused to think.
“Tell me, who is Shippeitaro?” he asked suddenly,
as he remembered the scene of the night before.</p>

<p>“Shippeitaro is a beautiful dog owned by our lord
the prince,” said the old man, wondering at the question.</p>

<p>“That will be just the thing,” cried the Samurai.
“Keep your daughter closely at home. Do not allow
her out of your sight. Trust me and she shall be
saved.”</p>

<p>He hurried away, and having found the castle of the
prince, he begged that just for one night Shippeitaro
be lent to him.</p>

<p>“Upon condition that you bring him back to me safe
and sound,” said the prince.</p>

<p>“To-morrow he shall return in safety,” the young
warrior promised.</p>

<p>Taking Shippeitaro with him he returned to the
village; and when evening came, he placed the dog in
the cage which was to have carried the maiden.</p>

<p>“Take him to the ruined temple,” he said to the
bearers, and they obeyed.</p>

<p>When they reached the little shrine they placed the
cage on the ground and ran away to the village as fast
as their legs could carry them. The young warrior
laughed softly, saying to himself, “For once fear is
greater than curiosity.”</p>

<p>He hid himself in the little temple as before, and so
quiet was the spot that he could scarcely keep awake.
Soon he was aroused, however, by the same weird chant
he had heard the evening before. Through the darkness
came the same troop of fearful phantom cats led
by a fierce Tom cat, the largest he had ever seen. As
they came, they chanted with unearthly screeches,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Whisper not to Shippeitaro,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the phantom cats are near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whisper not to Shippeitaro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest he soon appear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song was scarcely ended, when the great Tom
cat caught sight of the cage and sprang upon it with
a fierce yowl. With one sweep of his paw he tore open
the lid, when instead of the dainty morsel he had expected,
out leaped Shippeitaro! The noble dog sprang
upon the beast and shook him as a cat shakes a rat,
while the other beasts stood still in amazement. Drawing
his sword the young warrior dashed to Shippeitaro’s
aid and to such good purpose that in a few moments
the phantom cats were no more.</p>

<p>“Brave dog!” cried Wakiki. “You have delivered
a whole village by your courage! Let us return and
tell the people what has happened, that all men may
do you honor.”</p>

<p>Patting the dog on the head he led him back to the
village. There in terror the maiden awaited his return,
but great was her joy when she heard of her deliverance.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” she cried. “I can never thank you! I
am the only child of my parents, and no one would
have been left to care for them had I gone to be the
monster’s victim!”</p>

<p>“Do not thank me,” said the young warrior. “I
have done little. All the thanks of the village are due
to the brave Shippeitaro. It was he who destroyed
the phantom cats.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SWORD_OF_THE_CLUSTERING_CLOUDS">THE SWORD OF THE CLUSTERING CLOUDS
OF HEAVEN</h2>
</div>


<p>In the olden days the gods dwelt by the isles of the
Land of Many Blades, and there they used the swords,
To-Nigiri and Ya-Nigiri. These were magic blades,
but they were not so keen and terrible as the sword of
the Clustering Clouds of Heaven.</p>

<p>And this is the story of that sword:</p>

<p>Amaterasu, the sun goddess, had a superb sword,
whose flashing blade was like a gleam of light. This
sword she greatly prized, but a malicious dragon stole
it away and carried it to his den. The goddess cried
for aid to Susanoo, her brother, and he pursued the
dragon. It was a horrible beast with eight heads and
terrible claws, and it roared at the god with each of
its eight mouths.</p>

<p>Susanoo was a crafty and clever warrior and he knew
that he could conquer the dragon only by guile. So
he gave him soft words and smiles.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful warrior you would make, Sir
Dragon,” he said. “Had you but a sword you could
conquer the world.”</p>

<p>“I am not without a weapon and that a magic one,”
haughtily replied the great beast as he flapped his
mighty tail. “Behold!” and as he spoke Susanoo saw
that the magic sword was concealed beneath the
dragon’s tail.</p>

<p>“I drink to your health, O Wonderful One!” he
cried. “May you live as long as there is no one mightier.”
And he offered him a huge draught of <i>saké</i>.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“That is wishing that I may live forever,” said the
dragon, and he drank off the <i>saké</i> at a single gulp.</p>

<p>“You have said it,” said Susanoo with a deep reverence,
and he offered him a second cup for his second
head. By the time the dragon had taken eight cups,
one for each of his great yawning mouths, his heads
were so dizzy that he did not know at all what he was
doing, and so he lay down to rest under the cliff.</p>

<p>Then Susanoo crept up and quickly struck off one
of his heads and then another, and another until only
one was left. By that time the dragon was quite wide-awake
and very much enraged. He rushed at Susanoo
and would have devoured him had not Amaterasu seen
her brother’s danger. She sent a gleam of dazzling
sunlight into the dragon’s eyes so that he could not see
where he was going. Then Susanoo cut off the last
head, and seizing the magic sword, bore it in triumph
to his sister. She placed it in a shrine for safe-keeping
and there it remained for many a day.</p>

<p>It was not to rest there always, however, for another
hero was to wield it, and this was Yamato-Daké, son
of the Emperor Koan.</p>

<p>A terrible war was being waged with the savages
in the eastern part of Japan, and Yamato went forth
to conquer them, bearing with him the Sacred Sword.
But the savages were not easy to overcome. They laid
in wait in the bamboo thickets and sent showers of
poisoned arrows upon Yamato’s men, who were sore
afraid of them.</p>

<p>“A foe in the dark is as ten,” they cried. “We are
beset by the eight-headed dragon of Susanoo!” and all
of Yamato’s words of cheer and encouragement could
scarce persuade them to go on to battle.</p>

<p>“How can we fight what we can not see?” they
said.</p>

<p>The savages were well pleased and determined to
destroy the whole army at once. They therefore placed
a huge ring of brushwood around Yamato’s army and,
setting fire to it, they marched away.</p>

<p>But Yamato prayed to the gods, and, drawing his
magic sword, he cut and hewed the grass in front of
the fire until it drove back the flames. Then there
came a wind from heaven which fanned the fire until
it swept back whence it had come and lo! it overtook
the savages and burnt them until not one was left.</p>

us from the savages of the East.”</p>

<p>And Yamato hung up the sword at the Holy Shrine
of Atsuta, where it rests to this day; and the Mikado
said, “Henceforth shall it be called the Grass Mower,
and it shall be one of the three precious things of the
Mikados.”</p>

<p>But Yamato made answer, “As the deeds of the gods
are greater than the deeds of men, call it not Grass
Mower to honor Yamato, but still let it be known ever
as the ‘Sword of the Clustering Clouds of Heaven.’”</p>

<p>Beneath the gleaming snows of Fuji lay a great
forest. There many giant trees grew, the fir, the pine,
the graceful bamboo, and the camellia trees. The balmy
azaleas and the crinkled iris bloomed in the shade. The
blue heavens were fleecy with snowy clouds, and gentle
zephyrs caressed the blossoms and made them bow
like worshipers before a shrine.</p>

<p>Side by side there grew two bamboo trees. One of
these was tall, strong, and stately; and he reared his
haughty head to heaven and bowed not to the North
Wind as he passed. The other was a slender bamboo,
so slight and delicate that it swayed with every breeze,
and moaned with fright when a storm swept down the
wrath of the mountain.</p>

<p>The children loved the graceful bamboo, and named
her Silver Mist; but the big bamboo looked down upon
her with scorn.</p>

<p>“You bend and bow to every breeze. Have you no
pride? It is not fitting that a bamboo should show fear.
I stand straight and strong and bow to no one,” he said.</p>

<p>“You are going to be of some great use in the world,
I am sure,” said the humble bamboo. “I am only
fit to trim the houses for the New Year’s feast. But
you will become a beam in some great house or, maybe,
even in a palace.”</p>

<p>“Do not think I shall be only that,” cried the boastful
bamboo with a scornful laugh. “I am indeed intended
for something great. I think I shall be chosen
for the mast of a mighty ship. Then will the wings of
the ship swell with the breeze, and it will fly over the
ocean and I shall see strange lands and new peoples.
All men will behold me and will say, ‘See the stately
bamboo which graces yonder junk!’ As for you, poor
timorous one, you are not even brave enough to deck
the New Year’s feast. You will be used to make mats
for people to tread under foot.”</p>

<p>The slim little bamboo did not answer back. She
only bent her head and cried bitterly. The flowers
felt sorry for her and breathed their soft perfume about
her to comfort her.</p>

<p>As the days went by the slim bamboo grew prettier,
and the children loved her more and more. They
played beneath her waving branches, they made flower
chains and garlands and hung them from her boughs.</p>

<p>“See,” they cried in childish glee. “This is the
Lady Silver Mist. Let us tie a flower <i>obi</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> around her
slender waist;” and they bound a girdle of flowers
about her.</p>

<p>One day there came woodmen to the forest, and
they chopped down many of the trees, trampling the
grass and the flowers under foot. When they saw the
big bamboo they said,</p>

<p>“Here is a tall, straight tree. It will do for a mast.
We will cut it first.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the boastful bamboo to the slender
one. “I am going to see the world and do great
things. Good-by, child, I hope you will not be used
to make rain coats. When I am on the bright and
beautiful sea I shall remember and pity you!”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” sighed his little comrade. “Good fortune
go with you.”</p>

<p>The big bamboo was cut down, and the hillside saw
him no more. When, however, the woodmen came to
the little tree, they smiled to see it so beautifully garlanded
with flowers and they said, “This little tree has
friends.”</p>

<p>Then the children took courage and ran to the woodcutters
and cried, “Pray do not cut down our tree! In
all the forest we love it best. It is the Lady Silver Mist
and it has been our playmate for many moons.”</p>

<p>“You must dig it up and bear it away if you wish
to save its life,” said the chief woodman. “We are sent
to this forest to clear it, so that a grand palace may be
built upon the hillside where all is so fair and beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Gladly will we root her up and take her to our
home,” answered the eldest child; and very carefully
they dug her up, not destroying even a single root, for
the woodman helped them, so kind was he and of a
good heart.</p>

<p>They placed the slim bamboo in a lovely garden
beside the sea, and she grew fair and stately and was
happy. All around was calm and beautiful. The
sea waves lapped the coral strand. By day, the sun
shone on the tawny sands and turned them to gold;
the sky was blue as a turquoise, and pearly clouds
floated across it like shadowy angel’s wings. By night
the moon goddess rose in silvery beauty and bathed
the garden in light; it kissed the leaves of the bamboo,
until the dew sparkled upon them like diamonds in a
setting of silver.</p>

<p>Fragrant flowers bloomed at the bamboo’s feet: irises
from their meadow home, azaleas, rare lotus lilies, and
a fringe of purple wistaria wafting its breath in friendship
upon her. Here she grew in strength and grace.
All things were her friends, for she gave to all of her
sweetness; and to the winds she bowed her head.</p>

<p>“Great North Wind,” she said gently, “how thou
art strong!” And to the South Wind she said, “How
sweet and kind thou art!” To the flowers she gave
shade and to the children, who still loved her, companionship.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>One night she shivered and bowed her head very,
very low, for there came a storm from the sea, a storm
so fierce and wild as to frighten her very soul. The
waves of the sea tossed the white foam heavenward;
they rose up in giant walls of fury until ships sunk in
the troughs between and were dashed to pieces. The
beach was strewn with wrecks, and when daylight
came, Lady Silver Mist gazed upon the scene. She
recognized her old friend, the great bamboo, prostrate
upon the ground, while all around him lay bits of the
junk over which he had reared his haughty head.</p>

<p>“Alas! my poor friend!” she cried. “What a sad
fate is yours! Would that I could aid you.”</p>

<p>“No one can help me,” he replied with a moan.
“Would that I had been made into a common coolie
pole with which to push a country junk! Then might
I have been useful for many years! No, my heart is
broken, Silver Mist. Farewell.”</p>

<p>He gave a long shuddering sigh and spoke no more.
Soon some men who came to clear up the wreckage,
chopped the mast up for firewood; and that was the
end of the boastful bamboo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ANGELS_ROBE">THE ANGEL’S ROBE</h2>
</div>


<p>Once an angel bore to earth the soul of a child. She
bore it to a little bamboo house beside a bamboo tree,
and there it received a loving welcome. Many friends
gathered around to greet the little newcomer as soon
as they saw the kite<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> fly up from before the house.
Dear little kimonos were given the baby. One was of
the finest silk and embroidered with the crane and the
pine; for these mean long life in Japan.</p>

<p>The angel loved the little child she had brought,
and she tarried long at the window of the little bamboo
house among the trees and flowers. She felt glad that
she had brought the little one to such a happy home.</p>

<p>She had left her robe in the trees; for it had caught
there in her flight, and she had not waited to remove
it. A fisherman passing by, saw the beautiful, floating
silk and, loosening it, he said, “This is a very
pretty thing. I have never seen anything like it before.
I shall take it to my sweetheart.”</p>

<p>The angel heard him as she floated through the air,
and she cried, “I pray you, sir, give me back my robe!
I may not return to heaven without it!”</p>

<p>“Do not return, fair one,” he replied, dazzled by
her radiant beauty. “Stay here upon the earth and
delight us all with your grace.”</p>

<p>“Not so, not so,” she cried in fear. “Know you not
that an angel may not stay long on earth and live!
Her beauty fades, her soul grows sick within her, and
soon she is no more. Give me my robe and let me return,
for I pine for the pearly gates and the golden
streets.”</p>

<p>“I will return it if you will dance for me,” said the
fisherman; and the angel consented.</p>

<p>“First give me my robe that my dance may be more
perfect,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, no, my beauty,” he answered, “for then you
will fly away and I shall never see you dance.”</p>

<p>“Fie upon you, base mortal! Deceit was born of
man; the heavens know it not!” she said in displeasure.</p>

<p>Then the fisherman was much ashamed and gave
her the robe; and she danced for him a dance of wonderful
grace and beauty, such as mortal had never dreamed
of before. He wished to gaze forever at the lovely,
floating being. The moonlight shone upon her, bathing
her in silvery light, beneath the feathery bamboo,
with snow-capped Fuji above the clouds, calm and
serene.</p>

<p>While she danced, visions of heaven came to the
fisherman, and when she was wafted from his sight
by a snowy cloud, he sank upon the ground and, covering
his face with his hands, he wept bitterly, as he cried,
“Alas! alas! Nevermore will things of earth seem fair!”</p>

<p>In the far years of the twelfth century the Lord
Mikado was cursed with a terrible illness. All Nippon
prayed to the gods. Men offered all their richest offerings
to appease the wrath of heaven, but it availed
them naught. His Majesty grew worse and none of
the great men who came to him could divine the cause
of his trouble.</p>

<p>Every temple was full of devotees. Each shrine
had its worshipers, but Sorrow was the guest at every
door. His Majesty grew worse and worse, and every
night was stricken with a horrible nightmare.</p>

<p>At last it was noticed that each evening a dark
cloud moved across the heavens and hung over the
palace. From it shone two fiery orbs, gleaming fiercely.
The priests prayed and threatened, but the brooding
demon remained. At last a young warrior whose name
was Yorimasa came forward and said, “Let me slay
this horrid beast who, with his black breath and fiery
eyes, threatens the life of our beloved emperor. If I
fail I can but die and my life is the Mikado’s in any
case. Let me go!”</p>

<div class="section fullpage">

  <figcaption class="caption">“FROM IT SHONE TWO FIERY ORBS, GLEAMING FIERCELY”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>“Go, and the gods go with you!” the priests replied,
and Yorimasa went forth to conquer or to die.</p>

<p>He breathed a prayer to the great god Hachiman,
his patron, and set a heavy arrow in his well-strung
bow. Twang, went the bow string, and lo! the arrow
brought the monster low. It was indeed a fiend, terrible
enough to have destroyed the emperor, for it had
the head of a monkey, the claws of a tiger, the body of
a lion, and the tail of a mighty serpent.</p>

<p>Yorimasa was brave, however, and he made at the
beast with his good sword. Nine times he plunged
it into the ferocious monster’s breast, and at last it
fell dead.</p>

<p>The emperor now promptly recovered, and wishing
to reward Yorimasa for his bravery, he called him
and said: “At the risk of your own life, you have saved
that of your emperor. What will you have in reward?”</p>

<p>Yorimasa answered, “Most August One, my life
was your own. Why should I not risk it to save that
for which all Nippon would be honored to die? I
claim no reward. In my heart is joy that I have served
my emperor.”</p>

<p>“But I will reward you,” said the Mikado. “For
I should be as just as you are generous. Here is the
sword Shichi-no-O (the King of the Wild Boars) for
since you can wield a sword so nobly, it is fitting that
you have a noble sword, my brave Yorimasa. Two
things delight the heart of brave men, love and duty,
woman and warfare. Since you have been successful
with the one, I will give you success with the other.
It has come to my ears that you love Ajama<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
that she loves you. Take her and may you be happy
and may your children live and prosper and grow up
to serve their emperor as their father has served his.”</p>

<p>Then Yorimasa bent low before him and thanked
him; and a gentleman of the court composed a verse
about Yorimasa, and sang a song to him in which he
compared his rapid rise into favor to the cuckoo’s
flight toward the crescent moon. But Yorimasa was
as modest as he was brave and would not admit that
he deserved any special praise. So he answered the
poet’s song by singing these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">That only sent the shaft.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But he and Ajama were soon married, and lived
happily ever after, in the sunshine of the Mikado’s
favor.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, nearly a thousand years ago, a
man named Ononatakamura offended the Mikado
and was sent into exile. His wife loved him dearly
and wished to go with him, but, though she cried and
begged to be allowed to do so, the Mikado would not
permit her.</p>

<p>In her despair at being separated from her beloved
husband, she made up her mind to go to the Sacred
Shrine of Isé and pray for him. She stole quietly away
to the foot of Mt. Hi-yei, but not being used to walking
she soon grew weary and sat down to rest under a pine
tree. It was a beautiful country that she looked upon.
The hillside bloomed with flowers. The pines waved
their green branches against the soft blue sky, and,
serene and lofty, the mountains rose heavenward. A
kind wind caressed her brow as she sat resting, and the
murmur of the trees seemed to bring her comfort.</p>

<p>A farmer coming that way, she spoke to him saying,
“Good day, kind sir. Pray tell me how far it is to the
temple of Isé?”</p>

<p>“Twenty days’ journey,” he made answer, being a
rude fellow and unkind. He wished to annoy her, for
he knew well it was not so far.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<p>“Alas!” she sighed. “I shall never reach that sacred
shrine! How then shall my dear husband be brought
back to me! Surely the gods will hear the prayer of a
faithful wife, no matter where she may be. I will here
make my offering and my prayers, and the Eternal
Kindness will hear.”</p>

<p>Then she hung some coins upon a pine tree, and
prayed earnestly that the gods would bless her husband
and take her to him.</p>

<p>The farmer heard her, but his heart was still hard,
and when she went aside to rest he tried to steal the
money from the tree. But the gods had heard her
prayer, and the tree suddenly turned into a two-headed
serpent which spit fire at the thief’s approach. The
farmer was so terribly frightened, that he repented that
he had been so unkind; and he took the woman by the
hand and led her in safety to the shrine she sought.</p>

<p>Then were her prayers answered, for the gods
softened the heart of the Mikado, and when one told
him of the devotion of this good wife, he sent for her to
come to his throne.</p>

<p>“So faithful a woman should have a reward,” he said.
“What will you that I bestow upon you?”</p>

<p>“The return of my husband, Most Revered One,”
she answered; and straightway he sent word to Ononatakamura
to come back from exile.</p>

<p>Of the pine tree upon which the money had been
hung they made a shrine. Whoever was ill of any complaint,
and prayed there, was made well; and whoever
besought there any favor of the gods was sure to receive
it in abundance. And from that time the place
was called the “Shrine of the Hang-the-Money-Up
Tree.”</p>

<p>Amaterasu, the sun goddess, loved the earth. So
long had she shone upon it with her gracious light that
it was to her as a beloved child and she wished for it
all good things. When she found growing from the
body of Ukimochi, whom Susanoo had slain in wrath,
a mulberry tree, and also a silkworm, rice grains,
barley and beans she said to herself,</p>

<p>“Behold, the gods make good to grow out of evil.
From death comes life. The slaying of Ukimochi was
a deed of wrath, yet from it will come peace to the people
of the earth.”</p>

<p>She made barley and beans the seeds of dry places,
and rice the seeds of moor and fen. Mulberry trees
she planted upon the hillsides, and upon these she
reared silkworms so that the art of silk-weaving might
begin.</p>

<p>Having thus given to the world things of such usefulness
and beauty, the sun goddess desired to have
them cared for. So she commanded Susanoo to send
to earth his daughter, Mihashirano. He obeyed and
the daughter came down from heaven. But she could
find no place to live, and therefore wandered for a long
time to and fro in Nippon.</p>

<p>One day a fisherman named Sakino, who lived at
Itsuku, one of the isles of the sea, was casting his nets
near Okanoshima. As he fished he saw a curious boat
with a bright red sail coming towards him. There
seemed something strange about the boat; and Sakino
waited until it sailed close to him. Then he beheld
upon it the goddess Mihashirano, who spoke to
him.</p>

<p>“Sakino,” she said, “long have I passed to and fro
in the Isles of Many Blades, and watched by field and
moor and hillside to see the life-giving seeds which
Amaterasu bestowed upon you. Well nourished have
they been and watched so that you have had much
rice and barley. Now, wherefore have I not a shrine
built in my honor, where men may come to bring
thanks, and where I may dwell in peace?</p>

<p>“Go thou to the Mikado and request that he build
for me a temple at Miyajima; then will I protect the
Mikado’s land forever and ever.”</p>

<p>Sakino hastened to Kioto and revealed all this to
the Mikado. At that time there was a great famine
in the far provinces of Nippon, and the Mikado said,
“The goddess is displeased with us, and so this famine
has come upon my people. Hasten your return to
<span class="cor" title="Source: Itsuka" id="cor61">Itsuku</span> and build there a temple to do her honor. Here
is much treasure; go quickly and build.”</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Sakino was delighted with this task, and he hurried
homeward as fast as he was able. He could not at
first decide which would be the best place for the temple,
so he sailed around the islands seeking the loveliest spot.
Then as he sailed a strange thing chanced; for from the
very top of the mountain flew a huge bird, and it flew
ahead of Sakino’s boat all the way. This he took as
an omen, and he followed the bird closely until it stopped
and hovered over a wooded hillside.</p>

<p>“Here we shall build the temple of Mihashiranohime-o-kami,
the gentle goddess of the earth’s fruitfulness.
We shall raise a temple to do her honor,” he
cried. “The torii shall rise up out of the sea; the
light-bearing pillars shall guard the entrance, and men
shall come from far and near to see the shrine. Then
shall they see how the Goddess of Green-growing
Things is honored in the Land of Many Blades.”</p>

<p>This he did and the goddess dwelt happily in her
abode, and there was no more famine in the land; for
the shrine of the Goddess of Green-growing Things
is to this very day honored in the isles of Nippon.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>There was once a young noble who was very poor.
He was a Samurai who had offended his lord and so
was obliged to leave his own province and travel in
search of employment. It was very hard for him to
find anything to do, for neither he nor his fair young
wife had been taught to work.</p>

<p>“Alas! my bride! White as the lily art thou and
tender as the carnation,—to what has thy love for me
brought thee!” he cried.</p>

<p>But Tsuiu caressed him sweetly and said, “I am
happy since my lord has taken me with him. The
good-luck god will surely hear our prayers and we shall
find a fortunate issue.”</p>

<p>Then was the soul of Shindo lightened and he strode
along the highway gladly, and Tsuiu walked beside
him, and the breath of the morning was sweet and kind.
They walked for many hours and found no rest; but
the music of the grass-larks was sweet and the sun was
bright.</p>

<p>But when the shadows began to fall, and the fireflies
to flit among the tall grasses, and the moon to creep
slowly above the crest of the mountains, the little wife
drew closer to Shindo San; for in her terror she saw
robbers in every tree and bush.</p>

<p>“Be not afraid, my beloved,” he said, as he drew her
within his sheltering arms. “See! here is a pleasant
knoll beneath this sendai tree. Wrap yourself in my
mantle. Pillow your head upon my arm. Then may
the god of dreams send you a good-luck dream and
may your slumber be sweet. I will watch!”</p>

<p>“I will obey, my lord,” said Tsuiu. She closed her
eyes, and, holding the left sleeve of her kimono across
her face, she was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Shindo watched and waited, his hand upon his
sword; but he too was weary, and soon his eyes closed
and his head drooped. He slept and dreamed that
two huge dragons came out of the West and sought
to devour them; and lo! as he cried aloud in terror for
the safety of Tsuiu San, a greater Dragon came out of
the East and devoured the first two, and he and his
bride escaped.</p>

<p>Then he awoke suddenly and sprang to his feet,
putting O Tsuiu San behind him, for robbers were upon
him, and there were two. He drew his sword and fought
fiercely, but they well-nigh overpowered him. He felt
his strength fail. The blood was gushing from a wound
in his arm. Suddenly there appeared upon the scene
a ronin who quickly put to flight the robbers and saved
the life of Shindo.</p>

<p>Then he and O Tsuiu San thanked the ronin very
heartily, and finding the morning dawn at hand, and
hearing the morning bell from a distant temple, they
started on their way.</p>

<p>“Tell me first, whence you come and whither you
go,” said the ronin. “For I well see that you are of better
times, and that misfortune has brought you here.”</p>

<p>“We are in dire distress,” said the Samurai, “and
I have scarce a <i>yen</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to buy rice for the breakfast of my
wife.” Then he told all their story to the ronin, who,
being of a good heart, was grieved at their sorrows.</p>

<p>“It is little that I can do for you myself,” he said,
“since I am but a wanderer with nothing in my sleeves.
But come with me and I will set you in the way of making
a good but simple friend. Yonder are the towers
and temples of Yedo,” and he pointed to the roofs of
a city gleaming gold in the morning sun. “In a certain
street lives a tradesman, a poor fellow, yet of a
good heart. He bears the name of Chohachi. Seek
him and tell him I commend you to his kindness. My
road lies elsewhere. <i>Sayonara!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Bidding good-by to the ronin, the two hurried on
and finding Chohachi, he took them in and made them
welcome. There they remained several days until
O Tsuiu San recovered from her fatigue, and Shindo
from his wound. Then Chohachi spoke.</p>

<p>“Honored One,” he said, “very welcome are you
and yours to the shelter of our roof tree, but the rice
pot holds not enough for four. Is there any way in
which you are able to make the pot boil?”</p>

<p>“Good friend,” replied Shindo, “in the house of
my fathers the rice pot ever boiled without assistance
from me. I know no way.”</p>

<p>Chohachi knit his brows.</p>

<p>“Can the Honorable One teach the young men to
fence?”</p>

<p>“Alas,” cried Shindo. “I have little skill as a swordsman.
I fear I know not enough to teach fencing.”</p>

<p>“Can the Honorable One teach writing?” demanded
Chohachi.</p>

<p>“Of that I know even less,” replied his guest, so
mournfully that Chohachi hastened to reassure him.
“Some way shall be found to boil the pot even if we
have to hunt the magic paddle of the Oni.”</p>

<p>So the tradesman thought and thought.</p>

<p>“What can this dear fellow do?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>“It must be something of the easiest for he seems
not to have much thought for trading. I have it! He
shall be a waste-paper man! A boy or a simpleton
could do that!”</p>

<p>So he purchased a light pole of bamboo with two
baskets at the end, and a pair of bamboo sticks. He
called the Samurai “Chobei,” for Shindo was too fine
a name for a waste-paper man, and the Samurai was
started in business.</p>

<p>The first day Chobei lost himself, and had to pay a
man to guide him home. He had bought no waste
paper and Chohachi laughed at him, and scolded, too,
saying,</p>

<p>“Call out! No one will know what you want if you
walk about the streets in silence like a monk!”</p>

<p>Chobei was anxious to do all things right, for it
pained him to be depending upon the good trader, and
it hurt him still more to think of little O Tsuiu San
sitting all day over her embroidery, trying to earn a
few coins with which to boil the pot.</p>

<p>So, in order to grow used to the sound of his own
voice, he went to an open lot, where there was not a
house in sight, and shouted, “Waste paper! waste
paper!” all day until he was hoarse. The street boys
thought he was mad, and they laughed at him and threw
stones. Then he went home more discouraged than
ever, and Chohachi, choked with laughter, explained
again patiently,</p>

<p>“See, good Samurai, go into the back streets; rich
people do not sell waste papers. Talk with the women,
engage them with pleasant words and flattery, and then
say, ‘Perhaps you have some waste paper to sell.’”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“CHOBEI WENT FORTH TO TRY AGAIN”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>So Chobei went forth to try again, and this time
he sought in the poorer streets. There young women
were washing upon the steps, children were playing
upon the pavement, old women were talking in the
doorways, and to them all Chobei smiled and bowed,
“May the sun goddess smile upon you, honorable
august Madame,” he would say with his most courtly
air. “That you and your honorable family are in good
health is my wish. It gives me pleasure to meet you.
I am from a far street and I ask the honor of your
acquaintance. Have you any waste paper to sell?”</p>

<p>Although the good women understood, he might have
left unsaid all his remarks except the last. But they were
pleased with his air, and they ransacked their houses
for waste paper. They called him the “Knightly
Waste-paper Man,” and soon he had a very good trade
and earned many <i>yen</i>, which Chohachi helped him carefully
to spend. Then O Tsuiu San and the little daughter
whom the gods sent to them, were well cared for.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>One day the Knightly Waste-paper Man was crying
his wares through the streets when he saw a crowd
about a man who had fallen by the way.</p>

<p>“’Tis but a starving beggar,” said one. But Chobei
had learned much in the days when he had walked the
streets without a <i>sen</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in his sleeves, and his heart was
tender. He hurried to the beggar’s aid and to his surprise
found that he was no other than Bun-yemon, the
ronin who had helped him to escape from his home,
when his lord was angry so long ago. He caused him
to be taken up and carried home.</p>

<p>That night Chobei talked long with Tsuiu.</p>

<p>“Gratitude is a sacred duty,” he said. “But for
this ronin perhaps we should have been murdered, and
now that he has reached this low estate, it is our place
to help him, but how?” O Tsuiu San sighed.</p>

<p>“In all these years, my lord,” she said, “we have
lived by the favor of the gods, but we have saved
nothing. How much should we give Bun-yemon?”</p>

<p>“Not less than twenty-five gold <i>rio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>” said Chobei.
“It is a fortune! There is but one way in which we
might obtain it. We might sell Iroka.”</p>

<p>“Sell my daughter!” cried Tsuiu. “My lord, my
lord!” and she wept bitterly. Chobei wept also, but
at last he said,</p>

<p>“It is terrible for me as well as for you, but do you
not see that there is no other way?”</p>

<p>“There is no other way,” said Tsuiu, to whom the
will of her lord was law.</p>

<p>Then they told Iroka all the story and she said,</p>

<p>“Honorable parents, there is no other way. Permit
me to be sold, for it is an honor for me to become a
geisha for the debt of my parents.”</p>

<p>Therefore, with many tears, they sold Iroka and, as
she was very pretty, they obtained for her the sum of
five and twenty gold <i>rio</i>.</p>

<p>This Chobei bore to Bun-yemon who refused to
take it; but Chobei, pretending to restore it to his own
pocket, slipped it into a lacquered box and departed.
After he was gone, the wife of Bun-yemon found the
money, and her husband was very angry with her,
that she had not watched more carefully.</p>

<p>“This good fellow should never have given me the
money,” he said. “He is poor—only a waste-paper
man. I will not take it for anything. You must carry
it back.”</p>

<p>“But I know not where he lives,” said the wife.
“And since you have the money, let me go to the pawnshop
and redeem your jeweled sword, that we may
sell the sword for a larger sum. Then we can pay back
Chobei and still have something for ourselves.”</p>

<p>After much coaxing Bun-yemon at last consented to
do this and redeemed the sword. But the pawnbroker’s
clerk was angry, for he had expected to own the sword
for the small sum which had been lent Bun-yemon.
So he accused Bun-yemon of stealing the money and
officers came and carried him to prison, setting a watch
upon his wife.</p>

<p>She, however, determined to free her husband. The
Machi-Bugyo of Yedo was the most righteous of judges
and she went straight to him, escaping from the watchful
eye of the officers when there was a fire in the
neighborhood and every one was much excited. She
found the Machi-Bugyo, as he was riding to inspect
the firemen, and she knelt in the dust, catching hold
of his bridle rein.</p>

<p>“Most noble Machi-Bugyo,” she cried. “Honorably
deign to listen. They have taken my husband from
me, and they accuse him unjustly. You, who are the
friend of the poor, save him!”</p>

<p>The Lord of the city listened, and, being of a good
heart, he had compassion upon the wife of Bun-yemon.
He ordered the clerk of the pawnbroker to appear
before him, and also Bun-yemon. And Chobei, hearing
of the trouble, appeared and told that he had given
the twenty-five gold <i>rio</i>. Bun-yemon was therefore
cleared from the charge of theft.</p>

<p>“Go in peace,” said the Machi-Bugyo to him.
“The master of the evil clerk shall pay a fine of one
hundred gold <i>rio</i>, because a master should have only
honest servants. The wicked clerk shall be put to
death, for he witnessed falsely against an innocent man.
The gold shall be given to Bun-yemon who must, with
twenty-five <i>rio</i>, redeem the daughter of Chobei.</p>

<p>“As for you, Chobei, you have done well in paying
your debt of gratitude at so great a cost to yourself;
and your daughter is to be commended for her obedience.
Take this reward for you both,” and he gave
him a hundred <i>yen</i>. “Be dismissed, for I have spoken.”</p>

<p>Then were all happy, for Iroka was returned to her
parents and Chobei’s friend, Chohachi, was rewarded
for his kindness of heart.</p>

<p>The whole matter soon coming to the ears of the
Shogun, he commanded the old lord of Chobei to forgive
him and restore him to his home. Then was
Chobei, whom men again called Shindo, very happy,
and he no longer cried “Waste Paper!” through the
back streets of Yedo. But there he is not forgotten, for
when the women gather to gossip they speak of him
with smiles, saying ever of him, “Isuzure wo kite mo
kokoro wa <span class="cor" title="Source: nishike" id="cor72">nishiki</span> (coat of rags, heart of brocade).”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HUNTER_AND_THE_PRIEST">THE HUNTER AND THE PRIEST</h2>
</div>


<p>There was once a hunter who dwelt in the village
of Kyoto and sought his game upon the mountain of
Atagoyama. He was proud of being so mighty a
hunter, for he never came empty-handed from the
forest; yet at times he felt ill at ease. This was because
he made a daily business of killing, and so he
was displeasing to the Buddha.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>To set his conscience at rest, therefore, he often
made offerings of rice and fruit to a certain holy priest
who dwelt in a little shrine upon the mountain-side.</p>

<p>The priest was very good. Studying the sacred books
he dwelt in the solitude of the forest. He was so far
from the homes of men that he would have fared ill
had it not been for the visits of the hunter who brought
to him supplies of things to eat.</p>

<p>One day the hunter came to the temple.</p>

<p>“Honorable one,” he said politely, “I have brought
you a bag of rice. May each grain be a prayer for me.”</p>

<p>“Good friend,” said the priest, “I thank you, and
in return I will show you a miracle. For many years I
have read and studied and reflected upon the Holy
Books and it may be that I am receiving my reward.
Know then, that each night the Buddha comes to me,
here at the temple, riding upon an elephant. Do you
not believe? Then tarry and see.”</p>

<div class="section fullpage">

  <figcaption class="caption">“I WILL SHOW YOU A MIRACLE”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Speaking respectfully to the priest, the hunter said,
“I long to see this wonderful thing.” But in his heart
he said to himself, “This thing can not be true.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the little temple boy and asked,
“Have you seen this marvel?”</p>

<p>“Six times I have seen Fugen Bosatsu and fallen
before him,” said the boy; and the hunter marveled
again.</p>

<p>Dark and silent was the night, save for the wind
spirit who swept through the trees, now whispering
softly, now moaning as if in pain. Behind the clouds
the moon hid herself, throwing now and again fitful
gleams across the little shrine at the door of which
knelt the priest and his acolyte. Behind them stood
the hunter, his heart filled with unbelief. No word was
spoken and only a quick indrawing of the hunter’s
breath betokened his amazement as the vision came.</p>

<p>In the east arose a star, which grew and grew until
the whole mountain-side seemed light; and then there
appeared a snow-white elephant with six huge tusks.
Upon his back was a rider, and as the figures neared
the temple, the priest and the temple boy threw themselves
upon the ground, praying aloud to the Fugen
Bosatsu.</p>

<p>But the hunter had no prayer within his soul. This
thing seemed to him not holy but accursed, and, springing
in front of the priest, he set a shaft, drew his bow
to the full, and sent his arrow straight to the heart of
the Buddha. Straight to the heart it went, clear to
the feathers of the shaft, and lo! a terrible cry rent the
air. No longer was there white light over the mountain.
All was darkness.</p>

<p>“Demon in human form!” cried the priest. “Is it
not enough that you spend your vile life destroying
God’s creatures upon the earth? To this sin, must you
add that of destroying Buddha himself?”</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied the hunter. “Be not so rash.
Judgment of others is far too great a sin for one so holy
as yourself. Listen, and I will explain what I have
done. I have not destroyed the Buddha. You have
been deceived. Do you think it is possible that I could
see Fugen Bosatsu? I am a mighty hunter, stained
with the blood of living creatures. This is displeasing
to the Buddha. Now then, would he reveal himself
to me? The boy too is but a lad, and why should he
see holy visions? You think because you have read
and studied much, and because you are of a pure life
and a truthful tongue that the Buddha desires to do
you honor and reveal to you Fugen Bosatsu. No,
good sir, for were this true, you alone could see the
vision and it would not be vouchsafed to two sinful
ones beside.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you saw not Fugen Bosatsu, but something
deceiving and false; and when the morning comes I
will prove to you that I speak the truth.”</p>

<p>So when the morning broke in golden streams across
the mountain-top the hunter and the priest looked long
and carefully, and they found a spot of blood where had
stood the vision of the night. Another and another they
found, forming a slender trail which led deep into the
forest, and ever the crimson trail grew larger and larger
until at last they found a pool of blood beside the body
of a huge badger which lay dead, pierced by an arrow.</p>

<p>“See,” said the hunter. “You have been deceived
though you are far holier than I. All your study can
not teach you what I was taught by common sense.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PRINCESS_MOONBEAM">THE PRINCESS MOONBEAM</h2>
</div>


<p>A woodman once dwelt with his wife at the edge
of the forest, under the shadow of the Honorable
Mountain. The two were industrious and good, but
though they loved each other they were not happy.
No children had come to bless them and this the wife
mourned deeply.</p>

<p>The husband pitied her and treated her very kindly,
yet still she was sad. As she gazed upon the snows of
Fujiyama her heart swelled within her and she prostrated
herself and said, “Fuji no Yama, Honorable
Mountain, my heart is heavy because no childish arms
encircle my neck, no little head nestles in my bosom.
From thy eternal purity send some little white soul to
comfort me!”</p>

<p>The Honorable Mountain spoke not; yet as she
prayed, lo, from its heights there sparkled and glowed
a tiny light. Fitful and gleaming it seemed, yet it had
a silver radiance as of the moon.</p>

<p>The woodman’s wife beheld it, and she called to her
husband eagerly, “Come hither, I pray you. See the
strange light which comes from Fuji San. I seem to
see a face smiling at me. It is the face of a little
child!”</p>

<p>Then her husband smiled at her fancy, but, because
he loved her, he said indulgently, “I will go and see
what it is.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, my lord; go quickly!” she replied.</p>

<p>So, quickly he went to the forest, and as he neared
a mountain stream, with Fuji gleaming cold and white
in the moonlight, he saw the strange light, which seemed
to hover and rest upon the branches of a tall bamboo.
Hastening thither he found there a moon child, a tiny,
fragile, fairy thing, more beautiful than any child he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Little creature,” he said. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Princess Moonbeam,” she answered
sweetly. “My mother is the Moon Lady, and she has
sent me to Earth because every Moon Child must do
some good thing, else will its silvery light become pale
and wan and be of no avail.”</p>

<p>“Little Princess,” he said eagerly, “the best of good
deeds is to comfort a sad heart. Come home with me
and be a child to my wife, who weeps for children.
Thus will your beams grow bright.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you,” said the little Moonbeam, and,
rejoicing greatly, he bore her tenderly to his wife.</p>

<p>“I bring you a treasure,” he <span class="cor" title="Source: said," id="cor79">said.</span> “The Moon Lady
sends you this beam of light to lighten your sad
heart.”</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Then was his wife much overjoyed and she took the
little creature to her bosom and cared for her.</p>

<p>Lovelier grew the Moon Child every year and much
she rejoiced the hearts of her foster parents. Her hair
was like a golden aureole about her face. Her eyes
were deep and tender, her cheeks were pale and delicate,
and about her there was a subtle and unearthly
charm. Every one loved her, even the emperor’s son,
who, hunting in the forest, saw her lighting up the
humble cottage with her heavenly light. He loved her
dearly and she loved him, but alas! she could not
marry him because her life upon the earth could be but
twenty years. Then she must return to her home in
the moon, for so willed her mother the Moon Lady.</p>

<p>At last the day came when she must go. Her parents
wept, and could not be consoled; and her lover, who
was now the emperor, could not keep her, although he
besought High Heaven to spare her.</p>

<p>Her mother caught her up in a silver moonbeam;
and all the way to the Moon the little Princess wept
silvery tears. As the tears fell from her eyes, lo! they
took wings and floated away looking for the form of
her beloved, the emperor, who might see her no more.</p>

<p>But the silver-bright tears are seen to this day floating
hither and yon about the vales and marshes of fair
Nippon. The children chase them with happy cries,
and say, “See the fireflies! How fair they are! Whence
came they?”</p>

<p>Then their mothers relate to them the legend and say,
“These are the tears of the little Princess, flitting to
seek her beloved”; and over all, calm and eternal, smiles
the Honorable Mountain.</p>

<p>There was a poor woman in Yamato who was very
good. She prayed daily at the graves of her parents,
although she was very old. Daily she placed there some
grains of rice, although she was very, very poor. She
went to the temple whenever she was able, and prayed
much. She was kind to the poor and gave always
to the hungry, so that often she went hungry herself.</p>

<p>“It is better to be hungry than to grow hard of heart,”
she said.</p>

<p>Now they made a grand temple in Yamato and all
the people were proud and gave to it many <i>yen</i>. They
gave a lantern of bronze so wonderfully fine that all
men wondered, for the workmanship was delicate and
beautiful. The lantern makers had sat and wrought
upon it for days with matchless skill and patience. The
stand was large and the light so small as to seem but
a mere glimmer of the light of the world.</p>

<p>Many lanterns were given to the temple and a rich
man gave a thousand large ones.</p>

<p>“All men shall see that I am of a generous heart,”
he said proudly to himself.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<p>The poor woman was grieved at heart.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to give,” she said. “The gods would
accept nothing that I have.” She looked carefully
over her poor little house, but alas! There was nothing
any one would buy. She had only the barest necessaries
and these much worn and used for many years.</p>

<p>At last she bethought herself that she still possessed
one thing which she might sell. Her hair was yet long
and black. It might not bring much, but it would be
worth something.</p>

<p>“I am too old to marry, no one cares how I look,”
she said, smiling to herself. “I will sell my hair to
make a temple offering.”</p>

<p>So she sold it for a small sum, which happily she
found was enough to buy one little temple light. This
she joyfully placed upon the shrine.</p>

<p>How tiny it looked beside the rich man’s great ones!
Yet its light seemed to her to warm her old heart into
fresher life, and she was happy.</p>

<p>That night there was a great festival in the temple.
All the lamps were lighted, from the great ones of the
rich man to the tiny one which the poor woman had
placed there with such loving care.</p>

<p>The whole temple was aglow with light, and all the
people praised the rich man and said, “How generous
he is! How great!”</p>

<p>But just as they were praising him and admiring
the lights, there sprang up a sudden fierce wind. It
blew so wild a gust that the light of all the great lanterns
of the rich man went out, and all was darkness. Yet
not all—for lo! there gleamed through the gloom a
tiny light, as bright as the light of day. It was the little
light of the poor woman, which with its spark seemed
to light the whole great temple, and all the people
wondered. Then they looked with care to see whence
came the little light and when they found it was the
gift of so humble a soul they marveled again. But the
priest of the temple, who was old and good and very
wise, said, “Do not marvel! In the sight of the All
Knowing One, the poor gift of a good heart is more
worthy than all the splendor of the rich and proud.”</p>

<p>Far upon a Western headland the pine trees waved
their arms to the sea and the sea god loved them and
dashed his high foaming spray to send them greeting.
Giant <i>torii</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> rose heavenward, that the Golden Crow,
the strange and mystic Hobo Bird, might rest there,
in his swift flight toward the sun god.</p>

<p>The sea flowed restless and proud at the foot of the
cliffs and the beach was soft and treacherous, and the
sea god yearly claimed a victim, when the air was heavy
with the sweet scent of the wild pittosporum.</p>

<p>O Nitta San was a great warrior. He fought for
Go-Daigo the emperor and was his faithful general.
Many a battle he fought and won, though the men of
the Hojo Clan were many and strong and fought well.
But when he reached the headland of the pines, the
soul of O Nitta San was heavy within him.</p>

<p>“The men of the Hojo guard the sea with ships,
they watch the hills with archers,” he said to his head
man. “They are as many as the waves of the sea.
Our fate is in the hands of the gods!”</p>

<p>“The favor of the gods must be won, O Nitta San,”
said the head man. “I am of small account, but let me
throw myself into the sea, and perchance the sea god
may accept the sacrifice and smile upon you, my master.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied O Nitta San. “I myself will
appease the god of the sea, that he may grant us a
passage to conquer the city, for the glory of my master
the emperor.”</p>

<p>“Honorably the emperor will reward you,” said the
head man bowing low, but O Nitta San shook his head.</p>

<p>“I desire no reward,” he said. “Do you hear the
chirp of that bird? In a land where even the wild
songsters of the forest cry ‘Chiu,’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> do not think a
Samurai needs a reward.”</p>

<p>O Nitta San turned him to the cliffs, and he raised
his hands to the sea god and prayed long and earnestly.
Then he drew from its scabbard his sword, and lovingly
he gazed upon its keen and shining blade. He raised
it toward the clouds and it gleamed in the moonlight
like a shimmering serpent.</p>

“Well have you served me in many a fierce battle. You
are a friend as well as a servant. Now serve me once
again and appease the wrath of the sea god!” For a
moment he lovingly laid the sword against his breast,
then “God of the Sea,” he cried aloud, “accept my
sacrifice and care for the Soul of the Samurai.” And
so saying he cast far from him the sword.</p>

<p>It screamed through the air and smote the water,
and a myriad sparkling crystals rose into the air. They
leaped to encircle the sword, as if lovingly encrusting
it with diamonds. It rose upon a wave, it fell, the pearl-like
foam covered it, and O Nitta San saw it no more.</p>

<p>But from the sea came a dull murmuring sound, and
the waters rolled back from the cliffs and a passageway
appeared.</p>

<p>“Kompira has accepted my sacrifice,” cried O Nitta
San. “We may pass over in safety to conquest and
glory.”</p>

<p>Then the army passed over at the edge of the cliff,
and they fought a mighty battle with the Hojo and took
the city.</p>

<p>Go-Daigo was glad, and he greatly rewarded O
Nitta San who was proud and of a good heart fighting
for the emperor.</p>

<p>He offered much rice and millet to Kompira, god
of the sea, but never, so long as he lived, did he smile
when the sun-crested waves sparkled and broke into
diamonds before him, for he murmured to himself,
“Oh, Kompira, God of the Sea, deal gently with my
offering, be kind to the Soul of the Samurai.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DREAM_OF_THE_GOLDEN_BOX">THE DREAM OF THE GOLDEN BOX</h2>
</div>


<p>Hojo Tokimasa had two daughters. Musako, the
elder, was as beautiful as the eight beauties of Omi.
Her hair was as black as polished ebony, her eyes were
deep and dark and full of fire, her skin was smooth as
ivory. She was clever, too, as well as beautiful. But
her sister Ume was the favorite of her father.</p>

<p>Ume was sweet and gentle and her father thought
to marry her well, though she had not her sister’s
beauty.</p>

<p>One night, Ume dreamed a good-luck dream, that
a bird brought her a golden box, and she told her sister,
while she arranged the elder’s ebon locks in the early
morning.</p>

<p>“That is a dream of good omen,” said Musako.
“Give it to me and I will give you in return my golden
mirror, into which I have so often gazed.”</p>

<p>Now little Ume did not wish to part with her good-luck
dream at all; but, more than anything in the world,
she desired to share her sister’s beauty. So she said,
as she thrust a superb jade hairpin into place, “I will
give you the dream, fair sister, and may it bring you
good fortune; and so may I, gazing into your mirror,
gain some of your radiant beauty, for to you the gods
have been kind.”</p>

<p>Musako smiled at the flattery, and thought much
all day upon the happy dream.</p>

<p>Late in the twilight, when the moon shone through
the flowering plum tree and the fragrance of the plum
blossoms stole over the garden, and the nightingale
sang of love in the branches, there came a bold knock
at the castle gate.</p>

<p>When the gate was opened and the stranger bidden
welcome in the name of the god of hospitality, he spoke
simply, “I am Yoritomo. The men of the Taira pursue
me, and Kiyomori, their chief, has slain my father and
many of my father’s house. You are my father’s
friend. Of you I ask shelter.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome,” said Hojo. “Abide with us
until safety awaits you without.”</p>

<p>Then Yoritomo thanked him and did remain. Ere
long he sent his retainer into Hojo’s presence to act
as go-between, and ask him for the hand of his daughter
Ume. He had seen her. She was gentle and discreet.
She was the favorite of the old man, her father.
Why should he not be adopted into the family for her
sake?</p>

<p>But his retainer desired ever the best for his beloved
master. He had seen the radiant beauty of Musako
as she had walked in the arbor of wistaria, herself a
fairer flower, even, than the long purple racemes swaying
in the breeze. He decided in his own mind that the
elder sister was the one for his master.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>“The falcon may not mate with the dove,” he said
to himself. “O Musako San is far more beautiful than
her sister and more clever. She will be a better mate
for my glorious master than the gentle dove her sister.
I shall request her hand of Hojo San.”</p>

<p>So he demanded O Musako San from her father,
and that good man was much distressed.</p>

<p>“Truly I should like to give my daughter to your
master,” he said. “But she is promised to a lord of
the Taira Clan and I dare not break my word to him.”</p>

<p>Then the retainer returned to Yoritomo very sad.
He bore such glowing accounts of the beauty and cleverness
of O Musako San that Yoritomo’s curiosity was
fired, and by night he stole beneath the window where
she sat peering into the garden and wondering when
the good-luck bird would fly to her.</p>

<p>How fair she was! And when she saw the handsome
youth who gazed so ardently upon her, how kindly her
eyes looked upon him! Yoritomo determined that she
and no other should be his wife. He stole her upon her
very wedding day, not, perhaps, without her father’s
knowledge, and through all the troubles of his career,
she was his faithful wife.</p>

<p>But gazing into Musako’s mirror, the little sister
grew fairer every day, and she wedded a great lord and
bore him many sons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PRINCESS_OF_THE_SEA">THE PRINCESS OF THE SEA</h2>
</div>


<p>A beautiful princess lived in the depths of the sea.
She was fairer than any mortal maiden, and sweet as
she was fair. Her voice was as gentle as the sea waves
lapping the strand, her sigh was as soft as the sound of
the wind through the reeds of the shore, and her laugh
was musical as the tinkle of water through the coral
branches.</p>

<p>Her mother was no more, but her father, the old Sea
King, adored her and gave her all the treasures of the
deep. Her necklace was of coral, her girdle was of
pearls, her hairpins were of curiously carved tortoise
shell, her kimono was embroidered with feathery seaweed,
and her floating <i>obi</i> with delicate traceries of kelp,
encircled her slender waist.</p>

<p>The princess lived in a magnificent palace built of
mother-of-pearl. All the creatures of the sea had given
to its adornment. Pearls gleamed from its walls, amber
pillars, like shafts of light, supported its roof, while
a million lights gleamed from branching corals. The
walls were tinted in exquisite colors and decorated with
sprays of seaweed floating in cool green waves in which
the fish seemed really swimming, so natural did they
appear.</p>

<p>The princess did not always stay in this home,
beautiful as it was. She loved the fresh breath of the
open sea. It brought the color into her cheeks and
made her happy. When she went forth she rode upon a
dolphin, who plunged through the sea foam and rode
over the crested waves with careless grace.</p>

<p>One day the princess mounted his back for a long
ride. The next day and the next she went again and
always in the same direction. Then her father noticed
that she seemed sad, and he said to her, “Where do you
go each day, my daughter? Why is it that you do not
stay at home?”</p>

<p>“It is lonely here, my father,” she answered. “I
like to ride upon the top of the waves, for there I can
watch the strange beings who live upon the land. You
talk to me of marrying. Find me a sea-prince like one
of those mortals whom I have seen and I will marry
him.”</p>

<p>“Whom have you seen?” demanded her father,
much astonished, for he did not know that she had
ever seen a mortal.</p>

<p>“I know not his name,” said the maiden. “But I
have seen him upon the shore. He fishes there and I
have heard many of the fishes say how kind he is and
how gentle. He is handsome, too. He fishes only for
such sea food as he must eat and he puts back into the
water all those fish which are not good for him to eat.
Oh, my father! I love this youth! He is so great and
strong! Bring him to me!” and the little princess
clasped her hands together as she looked at her father.</p>

<p>But the Sea King was angry. “It is not fitting that
you should think such thoughts,” he said in high displeasure.
“A sea princess should not marry a mere
mortal. Tarry at home henceforth! No more shall
you go to ride upon the dolphin!”</p>

<p>So the poor little princess stayed at home and pined.
She missed the fresh air of the upper sea and the sight
of the blue sky, but above all she missed the young
fisherman. At last she grew weak and ill and her
father could endure it no longer.</p>

<p>“Are you pining still for that young mortal?” he
asked one day; and she replied,</p>

<p>“Oh, my father, unless I speak with him my heart
will break!”</p>

<p>“Go to the shore where he fishes,” said the Sea King.
“Change yourself into a sea turtle and allow him to
catch you in his net. You say he is of such a wonderful
kindness—well, Mortals do not eat such turtles; and
so if he throws you down upon the sands to die, I will
rescue you, but if he places you again in the water, I
give my consent to your bringing him here to my
palace.”</p>

<p>This the wily old king said, thinking the fisherman
would surely throw the turtle aside; but the princess
smiled happily, for she knew he would prove kind.</p>

<p>Now Urashima, for that was the fisherman’s name,
knew nothing at all of all this. When therefore next
day he found in his net a huge turtle, he said to himself,
“Well, my fine fellow, what a pity it is that you
are not eatable! You would make a good meal for my
honorable parents were you as good as you are big.
But since you are not, run along home to your friends,”
and he dropped the turtle back into the waves.</p>

<p>What was his surprise to see rise from the sea and
come toward him across the crested waves, a huge
dolphin, carrying on its back a sea nymph fair as the
dawn. She cast upon him a sun-bright glance and said,</p>

<p>“Come with me, oh Mortal! Come to the depths
of my sea-girt home and see my palace of emerald and
pearl. I was that turtle which you cast into the sea,
for I took that form to see if you were of as great kindness
of heart as the fishes said.”</p>

<p>Urashima stood spellbound and stared at the vision
of loveliness before him.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said the princess, again. “The
coral caves await you,—will you not come?”</p>

<div class="section">
<p>“Not for all the wealth of the ocean would I leave
my beloved home, but to be with you, loveliest of sea
nymphs,” cried Urashima, bewitched by her beauty and
loveliness.</p>

<p>He went with her to the depths of the ocean and there
memory fell from him, and he forgot his home. He
thought only of the princess and basked in the sunshine
of her smile.</p>

<p>So they were married and lived happily, and even
the old Sea King grew to like Urashima and blessed him
before he died.</p>

<p>Urashima had lived in the Dragon Palace of the
Princess of the Sea what seemed to him but a short
time when memory came to him again. He thought of
his father and mother and of his little brothers and
sisters, and he grew sad. The princess watched him
and her heart sank.</p>

<p>“He will go from me and not return,” she sighed.
“Alas! alas! for mortal love!”</p>

<p>Urashima at last said to the princess, “Beloved
princess, I have spent these months of our life together
in happiness so great that I would that it could last
forever. I remember, however, my old home and the
dear ones I left there. Give me leave, therefore, to
return to earth for but a day, that I may see them once
more. They know not where I am. They know nothing
of my happiness. Let me go, and quickly I will
return.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my beloved, you will never return,” she said.
“Never more will your deep sea home see you again,—that
my poor heart tells me. But if the yearning for
home has seized you, I may not keep you here. Go,
but take this with you,” and she handed him a casket
made of a single pearl and set with a picture of the
princess. “So long as you keep this unopened you
may return; but open it, and you will never see me again.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>So Urashima returned to earth bearing with him the
little casket.</p>

<p>His home seemed strange to him. The village street
was not what it used to be; his father’s house no longer
stood beneath the tall bamboo; he saw no familiar
faces. At last, puzzled and distressed, he asked a
passer-by if he knew aught of the people of Urashima.</p>

<p>“Urashima!” he answered in amazement. “He was
drowned in the sea, many, many years ago. His people
all lie buried on the hill. Their very tombs are lichen-grown
with age.”</p>

<p>“Am I dreaming,” cried Urashima. “My Sea
Princess, what have you done to me?”</p>

<p>Then seizing the casket he gazed upon the face of
the nymph and as he did so a strange desire came over
him to see what was within. He opened it just a crack
and a thin, gray smoke rose toward heaven, and in
the curling clouds he seemed to see the lovely form of
the princess, and her eyes gazed sadly at him. Then
he looked down at himself in wonder. From a stalwart
youth he had become a white-haired old man; and,
weeping bitterly, he stretched forth his hands to the sea.</p>

<p>“Ah, my princess, farewell forever. Without thee
I faint and die. Thy love alone gave life,” and he sank
down upon the sands and was no more.</p>

<p>He had been gone from earth a thousand years.</p>

<p>Shizoku of Matsui loved a maiden called Kennei-Botaru,
for she was bright and sparkling. Late one
snowy night he was returning from a wedding party
when amidst the tiny snowflakes which were beginning

him.</p>

<p class="noindent">he exclaimed, wondering that the <span class="cor" title="Source: O-botaro" id="cor104">O-botaru</span> (great firefly)
should be flitting about in winter snows.</p>

<p>As he gazed upon it, the creature flashed and darted

<p>Hither and yon it flashed, like a will-o’-the-wisp until
at last it darted away into the garden of the house
wherein dwelt his betrothed.</p>

<p>The next day he saw his beloved, and she said to him
shyly, “Last night I had a strange dream. I thought
I had wings and could fly and that I was flying through
the night. It was cold and there was snow in the air
and I said to myself, ‘Where is my beloved that I may
fly to his breast and be warm?’ Then I saw you coming
swiftly toward the bridge with your lantern, though
the moon shone bright in the heavens. Then I flew to
you, but you were not overjoyed to receive me. You
struck at me and drove me from you, and I fled in
terror into the garden where I hid myself in the heart
of a plum blossom, and the snow fell upon me and I
was cold. Then I awoke and I was afraid, and something
whispered to me ‘His heart is cold to you as was
the heart of the plum blossom when the snow fell upon
it!’ What means my dream?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I can not tell,” he made answer. “But
I know well you read its meaning wrong. Were I to
drive you from me and you to seek another, then would
your heart’s resting place be cold as was the plum blossom
of your dream. But trouble not yourself, beloved,
for never shall I drive you away,” and he smiled upon
her and the heart of O Botaru San was comforted.</p>

<p>Ota Dakwan was a noble <i>daimio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> His castle was
filled with retainers who waited upon him, at his least
word flying to obey his commands. Men vied with
each other to do him honor, bowing low before him
as he passed and saying “Behold Ota Dakwan, the
Daimio!”</p>

<p>Young maidens blushed at his name and when the
moon shone through the lattice, sighed to the nightingale
to sing the praises of this splendid warrior.</p>

<p>Honors crowded thick upon him, but of it all he
wearied and often sought the forest, there to hunt in
solitude. Where the great trees spread their branches
and the bamboos and the pines talked together he
spent many hours, returning to his castle at night,
weary, but with his game bag full.</p>

<p>Often people said to him, “What do you find so
wonderful in the forests of the hill country?”</p>

<p>“Sunlight and shade,” he answered, “everglade and
waterfall, game to hunt and no one to say me nay;
above all, the mighty mountain, cool and aloof as is
the spirit of the great;” and at his answer men wondered.</p>

<p>One day Ota Dakwan hunted long upon the mountain-side,
so long that he wandered far from home and
a great storm of rain came upon him, from which
there was no shelter. He was glad, therefore, when in
a lonely spot he saw a tiny cottage beside a grove of
great bamboos, and he ran to it for shelter.</p>

<p>Within was a young maiden who smiled upon him,
but spoke not. She was beautiful as a dream though
poorly clad, and he said to her, “Will you lend me a
straw rain coat? for every tree in the forest sends
down her showers and I shall be drenched before I
can reach my home.”</p>

<p>The maiden blushed deeply and without a word
hastily left the room. In a moment she returned, her
delicate cheeks flushed pink, carrying a <i>yamabuki</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
blossom which she placed in his hand, still with no
word, only a sigh and a blush.</p>

<p>“What means this?” he asked, much puzzled. “I
ask protection from the rain and you give me a flower.
Were you not as fair as the first cherry blooms of
spring, I could find it in my heart to be angry with
you. Speak!” But she only shook her head and
sighed, and, angry at last, he turned on his heel and
left her, going forth into the rain, the flower still in his
hand.</p>

<p>He, the adored of all <span class="cor" title="Source: Yeddo" id="cor110">Yedo</span>, to be laughed at by a
mere country maiden who would not even speak to
him! At this thought his heart rose within him, but
remembering how sweetly she smiled and how like a
rose she blushed, his anger melted away.</p>

<p>“She was as the flower she gave me, a mountain
rose,” he thought to himself. Then he raised the
delicate blossom to his face and its sweet scent was as
the breath of morning, fresh and kind. The rain
ceased, and hurrying homeward he was met by his
head man who greeted him anxiously. To him he
told his strange adventure, and the head man said,
“The poet says ‘the mountain rose has many petals
but it has no seed.’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The maiden meant to tell you in
poetic vein that she possessed no rain coat. She is the
fair, dumb daughter of your lordship’s keeper, and they
are very poor.”</p>

<p>“They shall be so no longer,” said the daimio.
“For one with so fair a soul should have fairer surroundings,
and one upon whom the gods have laid a
finger should have kindness from those of this world.”</p>

<p>Then he showed much kindness to her father, and
to the maiden, sending to them gifts of rice and tea
and rich garments. And oftentimes, when tired with
his morning’s hunt, he would rest within the little
lonely hut, and Yamabuki would serve him a cup of
tea with a shy grace. Whenever he spoke to her it was
with kindness and she would smile and blush and sigh
a little, while he murmured to himself, “The god of
silence laid his finger upon your lips, Yamabuki, little
silent one.”</p>

<p>When the Spirit of Creation had finished his work,
he came down from Heaven and gazed upon what he
had done.</p>

<p>He saw the mountains gleaming pure against the
blue, the rivers winding silvery to the sea, the rice
fields lying warm and moist in the valleys—and it was
good. He gazed upon the trees waving in the wind,
the iris fields and the lotus ponds, the cherry blooms
and the plum blossoms, and he smiled well pleased.</p>

<p>Then the Evil One appeared to him and with a hateful
voice said, “Do not flatter yourself that you have done
all well in this world. Indeed you have not. There
are many things which are neither pretty nor useful.
See how ugly this thistle is, and of what use is the
bramble? Had I made things I would have done much
better.”</p>

<p>Then the Spirit of Creation was very angry. He
thought a thing of wrath and created a rat. It was
large and fierce, and it quickly jumped into the mouth
of the Evil One and bit out his tongue. Then was the
Evil One in great rage and he uttered horrid cries and
danced an evil dance upon the grass. He thought to
himself, “Since the rats are here, they shall be made
to be a torment to the earth,” and he made them increase
greatly until they overran the Land of the Ainu.</p>

<p>At this the people were very unhappy. “Oh, Creating
Spirit,” they cried, “take away these pests, for they
eat our grain and our rice, they gnaw our huts, they
frighten our children. Destroy them, oh kind Creating
Spirit.”</p>

<p>But the Spirit shook his head. “Not so,” he said,
“I may not destroy that which I have once made.
But I will create another thing which shall war with
the rats, and so you shall be helped in your distress.”</p>

<p>He created straightway cats and the cats warred
greatly upon the rats so that they grew less. Then
were the people pleased and rejoiced, but an old man
said to them, “Speak not evil of the rats, nor of anything
which the Creating Spirit has made. It must be
that the Creating Spirit is displeased when his works
are spoken ill of, for he punished the Evil One for so
doing. Besides, everything created is of some use.
Even the rat bit off the tongue of the Evil One.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PAINTER_OF_CATS">THE PAINTER OF CATS</h2>
</div>


<p>Once upon a time a long, long time ago there was
a boy who was clever and polite and kind, and it would
seem as if he was a very fine boy indeed. But he had
one fault. He would draw pictures of cats.</p>

<p>Now that does not appear to be a very bad fault,
but the trouble was that Kihachi would not do anything
else. He drew cats at school when he should
have been studying his lessons. He drew them when
all the other children were at play and when it would
have been far better for him to have been running and
jumping.</p>

<p>When his brothers and sisters were sleeping peacefully
at night upon their wooden pillows, Kihachi
would arise from his sleeping mat and, stealing to the
paper partitions of the little room into which streamed
the moonlight, he would draw cats. In the early morning
when the sun gleamed over the tiny garden and the
dew lay like jewels upon the rice fields, still Kihachi
could be found drawing cats.</p>

<p>He drew large cats and small cats, mother cats and
kittens. He drew them even upon his clothes, and this
caused his mother much annoyance, though she was
very patient. When, however, it came to pass that she
found a whole family of kittens playing their pranks,
in pencil, upon her own best <i>obi</i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> she felt that something
must be done.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she said to her husband, “this boy and
his cats make me too much trouble. I have done
everything to cause him to stop, but to no avail. I
have even burned him with the <i>moxa</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but still he
does not cease. He says he can not. Our other sons
are able to help you in the field and our daughter is a
great assistance to me in the household. But Kihachi
does not work, and his schoolmaster says he will not
study. He will do nothing but draw cats. What shall
we do with him?”</p>

<p>“It may be that so strange a boy will grow up to be
something quite different from us,” said his father.
“He is always agreeable. Every morning he says most
politely, ‘O hayo, O tat’ San, O hayo, O oka San.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
It seems to me <i>Bot chan</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is not bad. Perhaps he would
make a good priest. Let us take him to the temple and
see if he will not there forget his cats.”</p>

<p>So they took him to the temple and the priest received
them with courtesy. “Enter, honorably enter!”
he said, and they entered saying, “We have brought
to you our youngest boy in the hope that you will
graciously permit him to become your acolyte.”</p>

<p>The priest asked Kihachi many questions, very
difficult ones, and these he answered so cleverly that
the old man said to the parents, “This child is destined
to be great. He is very clever. Leave him with
me and I will teach him all he needs to become a
priest.”</p>

<p>So Kihachi stayed in the temple and he studied
very hard. He liked to get up early as the mists were
breaking over Fuji San and the temple bells were
ringing in the dawn. He loved to sit in the twilight
when the flowers of the <i>yamabuki</i> are mirrored in
the still marsh waters. He loved to pluck the primrose,
flower of happiness, and to twine it with the
<i>nanten</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> into wreaths for the shrine of Buddha. He
liked to read and to study the sacred books and he
learned many prayers, but still he liked to draw, and
still he drew cats.</p>

<p>He drew them on the margins of the books, on the
prayer rolls, on the very <i>kakemonos</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of the temple,
and this much displeased the good old priest.</p>

<p>At last he could not stand it any longer and he called
the boy to him. Kihachi bowed very low, his hands
and forehead touching the floor.</p>

<p>“Bot chan,” said the priest, “you will never make
a good priest. You may some day become a great
artist, but you will never be anything else. You had
better go away from the temple and seek your fortune
in the world. Here is a bag of rice for you. Put it
in a bundle of your clothes, and go, and may good
fortune go with you. I will give you one last bit of
<span class="cor" title="Source: advice," id="cor118">advice.</span> When darkness gathers, fear great places, seek
small shelter.”</p>

<p>Kihachi thanked the priest and went mournfully
away from the temple. It seemed to him as if he was
always to be unhappy because of his cats, but he
could not help drawing them. He was afraid to go
home, for he knew his father would punish him for
disobeying the priest. He did not know what to do.
At last he thought of a large temple in the next village,
and wondered if some of the priests there would not
take him for an acolyte.</p>

<p>“At least I can try,” he said, and hurried on, hoping
to reach the temple before night.</p>

<p>It was a long way, and his feet grew very sore and
he was tired. So it was a great disappointment when
he reached the temple to find it deserted. Not a priest
was there to offer incense, not an acolyte to ring the
temple bells.</p>

<p>“How strange it is that everything is covered with
dust! There are cobwebs spun over the altars!” he
said. “It seems to me an acolyte is needed. I shall
stay at least for the night and perhaps to-morrow the
priests may return. They will commend me if I make
things very clean.”</p>

<p>He laid down his bundle and began to clean the
temple with a will, and soon it was quite free from
dirt and dust. Then he sat down and rested, but
noticing a large screen with quite a blank space upon
it, he drew out his writing box and began to draw
cats as hard as he could draw.</p>

<p>He thought nothing of how time was passing until
suddenly he noticed it was growing quite dark, and
he began to be a little afraid. He looked about him.
How huge and deserted seemed the temple hall! How
small a boy he was! Then he remembered the old
priest’s parting words, “When darkness hovers, fear
great places, seek small shelters.” Surely this was a
great place! He hunted about hoping to find a small
place which might be safer, and, surely enough, there
was a tiny recess in the wall with a door which could
be slid into place. He entered and found there was
just room enough for him to curl up and go to sleep,
which he did, for he was so tired that sleep came to
him quickly.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>He slept soundly, but at last was awakened by a
loud noise. It seemed as if a thousand ogres were
fighting, and with the noise of the fighting came horrid
screams. Kihachi was afraid to make a peephole in
the paper partition, and so he lay very still until at
last there was a more awful scream than before and
the sound of a heavy fall. Then all was still.</p>

<p>Kihachi lay quite still until the morning light began
to creep into his cabinet, and then he thought, “I
must get up and ring the dawn bell; for when the
priests return they will be pleased to find that I have
attended to everything.”</p>

<p>So he jumped up and hastened to ring the bell.
Pure and clear its tones rang out over the cool morning
air, and Kihachi noticed figures in the valley below
moving rapidly, and he said, “Here come the priests.
I hope they will be pleased with what I have done.”</p>

<p>Then he went to look at the cats he had drawn in
the great temple hall the night before. But what a
sight met his eyes! Upon the floor of the temple was
a pool of blood and beside it the body of a fierce and
terrible rat, the largest he had ever seen. It was as
large as a cow, indeed it was a monster rat goblin.</p>

<p>“What killed you?” he cried, “there must have
been a battle royal here in the night, for I heard sounds
as if an army of cats was let loose.”</p>

<p>Then his heart stood still, for he saw that the mouths
of all the cats he had drawn were covered with blood!</p>

<p>“My cats killed the rat goblin!” he cried joyfully;
and at that moment he heard steps and turning, saw
the headman of the village with several other men
entering the temple.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” asked the headman. “Do
you not know that this temple is haunted by a terrible
rat goblin? Surely you did not spend the night
here?”</p>

<p>“I spent it quite comfortably,” said Kihachi, “and
I think the goblin is dead.” Then he showed the headman
the rat and his cats, and told him what had happened
in the night. The headman said, “It is well
that you obeyed the old priest’s instructions to ‘seek
small shelters.’ This goblin has haunted the temple
for many months and no one who has come here has
ever returned. Your cats are very lifelike; I believe
that some day you will be a great artist. In the city
yonder you will find my brother. Go to him and tell
him your story. He will help you. You have done
my village a good turn with your cats, so here is a
present to help you along;” and he gave him twenty
<i>yen</i>.</p>

<p>Then was Kihachi very glad in his heart, and he
made his thanks to the headman and went his way.</p>

<p>And thereafter, when he became a great artist and
taught many boys to draw, he laughed as he told his
pupils, “My first great picture was a drawing of cats,
and for it I received twenty <i>yen</i>.” And his pupils
were much astonished and called him always “The
Painter of Cats.”</p>

<p>Long ago the river of Kashigoye flowed into the sea
by the Marsh of the Terrible Dragons. The dragons
were five, and yearly they came forth and devoured
the maidens of the village and there was no way to
hinder. But the people cried loudly to Benten Sama,
the goddess of mothers, the bestower of love and beauty.</p>

<p>Now Benten Sama had many sons: Daikoku, who
gives wealth, Ebisu, who is the god of fishermen, Hatei,
who is full of mirth, and others equally renowned.</p>

<p>Of all these sons, Benten Sama loved Ebisu best,
and for his sake all fishermen were dear to her. When,
therefore, O Ume San, daughter of the headman of
the village, besought the blessing of the gentle goddess
upon her lover, a fisherman, Benten Sama listened.</p>

<p>“Goddess of Mercy,” murmured the girl. “Send
thy blessing upon him, for my honorable father will not
consent to our union. He says, ‘When the five Dragons
of the Marshlands are no more thou shalt marry this
fisher lad.’ I pray you, gentle goddess, soften the heart
of my father, and may thy son Ebisu bestow his favor
upon Hakuga.”</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Benten Sama listened to the girl’s prayer and smiled.
She whispered to her son and he was kind. He filled
Hakuga’s nets with fish and these brought many <i>yen</i>.
He then approached the father of O Ume San and besought
of him his daughter, his Go-between<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> saying,
“Honorably deign to listen to the prayer of Hakuga
and give to him your daughter, for he has many <i>yen</i>!”
But the father replied ever the same, “When the five
Marsh Dragons are no more,” and the Go-between
returned sadly to Hakuga.</p>

<p>Then the maiden prayed again to Benten Sama and
she said, “Kind Goddess, hear! Send some curse upon
the five Marsh Dragons, that Hatei your son may bestow
mirth upon us, for we are sad.”</p>

<p>Then Benten Sama thought, and that which she
thought was good. It was the time of the red maple
leaf<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Tatsu Hima<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> ruled. Benten Sama asked
her aid, as she flaunted her banners upon the hillside,
and that night there came a fearful storm. The storm
howled and shrieked, and all the people cowered in
terror. All night it raged, and the thunder god gave
five mighty roars, and at each roar a dragon lay dead.</p>

<p>And when the sun god lighted the world, all was still
and smiling, the Marsh of the Dragons was gone, and
in its stead rose an island, green and beautiful, and
above it hovered Benten Sama, throned upon a rainbow.</p>

<p>Then were the people much pleased at their deliverance
from the five Dragons of the Marsh, and they
made a shrine to Benten Sama at that point where she
had appeared.</p>

<p>And O Ume San married the fisherman and they
lived happily ever after.</p>

</div>


<p>Once there was a poor woodcutter who toiled early
and late for a living. He worked harder than others,
because he loved his old father and mother dearly,
and wished to give them all the good things of life. But
though he was more diligent than any other woodcutter
of the village, he never seemed able to gain
enough <i>sen</i> to buy <i>saké</i> and tea, but only enough for
rice and bread.</p>

<p>One day he climbed high up on the mountain to find
the best wood. It was a very steep mountain, and no
one else would try to climb so high. So he worked
alone. Chop, chop, his axe broke the stillness and soon
he had a goodly pile of logs.</p>

<p>Stopping for a moment to rest, he saw a badger lying
asleep under a tree, and he thought to himself, “Aha,
my fine little beastie! You will make a fine morsel for
my father’s supper. He and my mother have not tasted
meat for many a day.”</p>

<p>The longer he looked at the badger, however, the
less he wanted to kill him. He was such a little creature
and it seemed mean to kill a sleeping thing and one so
much smaller than himself!</p>

<p>“No,” he said to himself at last, “I can not kill him!
I will but work the harder that I may earn money to
buy my parents some meat!”</p>

<p>Now the badger seemed to understand and approve
of this resolve on the part of the young woodcutter.
He opened one eye and then the other. Then he
blinked saucily at the woodcutter.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said. “That was a wise conclusion.”</p>

<p>The young man dropped his axe and jumped high
into the air, so great was his astonishment at hearing
a badger talk.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t kill me if you tried,” said the badger.
“Besides, I am far more useful to you alive than dead.
And now, because you have proved yourself of a kind
heart, I will show you kindness. Bring me the flat, white
stone which lies beneath yonder pine tree.”</p>

<p>The woodcutter turned to obey, and suddenly
stopped in wonder. Spread upon the stone was the
finest feast he had ever seen. There were rice and <i>saké</i>,
fish and <i>dango</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and other good things. He sighed as
he looked, for he wished he could take the food home
to his parents.</p>

<p>“Sit and eat,” said the badger who answered his
thoughts as if they had been spoken. “Your father
and mother shall eat the same.”</p>

<p>The woodcutter obeyed, but when he tried to thank
his little friend, he saw that the badger was gone and
that, just where he had sat, there was a sparkling,
tinkling waterfall. It rippled over stones and crags
and sang a sweet little song, and as the woodcutter
stooped to drink of it lo! the waterfall flowed with <i>saké</i>!
It was the richest he had ever tasted and he filled his
gourd with it and hurried home to share it with his
parents.</p>

<p>When he arrived there and had told his story,
his mother smiled and said, “Thou art a good
son.”</p>

<p>“We have fared as well,” his father said, “for we
found spread for us just such a feast as yours, though
we knew not at all whence it came.”</p>

<p>Next day the young man went early to his work. As
he climbed the mountain he saw, to his surprise, a troop
of woodcutters following him, and each carried a
gourd. Some one had overheard him tell his father
of the waterfall which flowed <i>saké</i>, and all the woodcutters
of the village wished to taste of the wonderful
drink.</p>

<p>When they drank, however, they were filled with rage,
for to them the waterfall flowed only water. Then they
reviled the youth and cried,</p>

<p>“Base one, you have beguiled us here on false pretenses!
You have spoken falsely! We have toiled here
for nothing! You are an evil fellow!”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“THE WOODCUTTER STOOPED TO DRINK OF IT”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>But he replied calmly, “I did not ask you to come.
For me the waterfall flows <i>saké</i> still, as sweet as yester-eve.”</p>

<p>They went away in great anger, and as they went the
waterfall almost seemed to laugh, so gayly did it tinkle
over the stones. When the woodcutter drank, however,
the laughter turned to music and a sweet voice crooned
a gentle song,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thereafter it was the same. Whenever the woodcutter,
worn with toil, stooped to drink from the sparkling
waterfall, or at night when he filled his gourd to
bear to his father at home, the <i>saké</i> flowed free and
clear and delicious. And ever the tinkling voice repeated,
over and over to the music of waters falling,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BOY_AND_THE_SPIRITS_OF_THINGS">THE BOY AND THE SPIRITS OF THINGS</h2>
</div>


<p>There was once a little boy of the Ainu who was very
wise. He seldom played with the other boys, for the
spirits of things were his playmates. No one could see
his playmates, but he talked to them and loved them
better than all the children whom he knew.</p>

<p>“My friends tell me strange things,” he said; and his
mother asked, “Who are your friends and what strange
things do they tell you, my child?”</p>

<p>“My friends are the spirits of things,” the boy made
answer. “I can not tell you what they say, but the spirit
of the pine tree whispers to me the things the spirit of
the north wind tells to him; the tall bamboo spirit bends
down as the tree sways, and talks of the sun’s glowing
rays; the birds and blossoms speak to me of the earth’s
beauty. Even the common things have spirits and they
tell me many things.”</p>

<p>The boy’s mother sighed, as she looked at him, for she
thought he was too wise.</p>

<p>One day the boy fell ill. He was very sick, but no
one knew what was the matter with him. He drooped
from day to day and seemed not to care for anything.
And it was the winter time.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“THE BIRDS AND BLOSSOMS SPEAK TO ME”</figcaption>

</div>

<div class="section">
<p>One day his mother came to him and said, “My son,
the first plum blossom is seen upon the trees. The sun
is warm. Will you not go out of doors to see it?”</p>

<p>“The plum blossom spirit whispered me of its coming,”
he said. “I will go and see.”</p>

<p>Then he crept slowly from the little thatched hut
and, resting at the door, he saw the plum blossom and
smelled its delicious fragrance. He smiled a little and
then a queer look came into his eyes. He held his chin
in the palm of his hand and sat quietly nodding his
head once or twice as if saying, “Yes.”</p>

<p>At last his mother could bear no longer to be without
his thoughts. She feared to lose him, and she felt
jealous of everything that came near to him. “Tell
me what you think, little son,” she said.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” the boy answered. “Oftentimes a
boy and girl come to play with me. They are Spirit
Children and we play many things. To-day they have
told me why I am ill. It is this. My grandfather had
a fine axe. With it he made many things, a tray, and
a pestle to pound millet, and others. But my father
threw away the axe, forgetting how well it had served.
Now it lies rusting, and the spirit of the axe is angry.
Because the spirit of the axe is angry, it has made me
ill. So, if you do not wish me to die, you must tell my
father to seek the axe and do honor to its spirit.”</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say, my son,” said his mother,
and she sought his father and told him all. Then he
found the axe, and polished it carefully until it shone.
He made for it a new handle of ironwood, and carved
it with care. And to it he set up a worship stick. This
stick was tall, and its feathers curled and waved in the
breeze.</p>

<p>Then the spirit of the axe was happy, and the boy
was made well, so that joy fell upon the soul of his
mother.</p>

<p>And when he grew to be a man, he became a great
augur, for the spirits of things came often to him and
told him much that was concealed from other beings.
For the spirits of things were his friends.</p>

Her father was dead, and she worked very hard to support
her mother who was ill. The mother had trained
her daughter in the best of manners, therefore O Cho
San had no trouble in finding work.</p>

<p>There was a certain nobleman in need of a maid
servant, and he approached O Cho San and asked her
to serve him.</p>

<p>“What would my duties be?” inquired the girl as
she respectfully bowed to the ground before him. “I
must hear, and then I can tell if I can do them.”</p>

<p>“They are all the common duties of a maid,” he
replied—“all but one thing, which is most strange.
You will have the care of the porcelain plates of my
fathers.”</p>

<p>“But that is not a strange duty for a maid,” answered
O Cho San. She smiled at him, showing her pretty
white teeth and a dimple in one cheek. “I have washed
china before this, and always with care.”</p>

<p>“Yet it is the one thing which is most hard,—to find
a maid who will attend to this,” he answered. “Know,
O Cho San, that the porcelain is priceless. There are
twelve plates and each one is perfect. They are so old
that they are of the fashion of the Owari potter who
learned the secrets of Karatsu and made a flight of
cranes across the blue sky.</p>

<p>“The porcelain is so beyond all value that my ancestor
made the law that whoever broke a plate should
straightway have a finger cut off. So you see the china
must be washed with care.”</p>

<p>O Cho San clasped and unclasped her slender brown
fingers nervously, then she hid them quite away in
the sleeves of her kimono. Her cheek paled a little,
but she said bravely, “I will take the place, most
honorable sir, and I shall try to keep my fingers.”</p>

<p>Then she thought to herself, “It is not the most desirable
of places to live where one loses a finger for each
nick of china, but the <i>yen</i> he pays are many more than
I can earn elsewhere, and my dear mother must have
tea and rice. Besides, it is not likely that such costly
porcelain can be often used, and when it is, I shall offer
many prayers that it be used in safety.”</p>

<p>So O Cho San served the nobleman faithfully.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that she was a favorite with all,
for she had manners of such engaging gentleness that
every one loved her. At first this pleased her. When,
however, she found that even the master’s son was in
love with her, she was unhappy.</p>

<p>She did not care at all for him, and she knew that to
marry him would displease her master, who was kind
to her. So she refused to listen to the young man,
and this made him very angry. Being bad at heart,
he resolved to be avenged upon her.</p>

<p>“I will ask my father to give a party at which the
porcelain plates shall be used,” he said to himself.
“She will surely break one, and then she will turn to me
to save her from her punishment. If she does not, she
will lose a finger;” and on his face there was a cruel
frown.</p>

<p>As he had said, so it was done. The master gave a
supper and the priceless dishes were used. Thanks
to the kindness of the gods who watch over little
maidens, O Cho San washed them, dried them on the
softest of paper napkins, and set them carefully away
all unbroken. But alas, when the master came to look
them over, the bottom one of the pile was broken.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement.</p>

<p>O Cho San wept and proclaimed her innocence.</p>

<p>“Honorable Master,” she cried, “it is another hand
than mine which has broken it. But if I am to be
punished, cut a piece from my face instead of my hand.
Then I may still work for my mother.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“O CHO SAN PROCLAIMED HER INNOCENCE”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>“The law of my fathers required a finger for each
plate broken,” said the master sorrowfully; for although
he liked the gentle little maid and did not wish to hurt
her, he feared to disobey the law.</p>

<p>“You shall not cut even her finger nail,” suddenly
cried a rough voice. The group around O Cho San
turned in astonishment to see who dared speak so to
the master.</p>

<p>It was Genzaburo, a servant, very rough but honest
and good.</p>

<p>“O Cho San may not be punished for what she has
not done,” he said. “I myself broke the plate. You
ask me why? Because I love O Cho San. She is as
fair as the cherry bloom in early spring, but to me cold
and remote as the snows upon the crest of the mountains.
I thought to myself, she is a Samurai’s daughter and
will never marry me. But if she lose a finger no one
else will marry her. Therefore in time she will turn
to me, and I shall win her for my wife. Then I broke
the plate.”</p>

<p>“How did you break it?” demanded the master
sternly.</p>

<p>“That I will show you,” said Genzaburo. “It was
very simple. I was told to mend the lid of the box in
which the plate was kept. Then I thought of the
plates, and I drew forth one and <i>bang!</i> my hammer fell
upon it just like this!” and he brought his hammer
down with great force.</p>

<p>There was a crash terrible to hear, a scream from
O Cho San, an exclamation of rage from the master,
for the hammer had descended upon the pile of plates,
and of the beautiful porcelain nothing at all remained
but fragments.</p>

<p>In all the confusion Genzaburo alone was calm. He
stood smiling at the ruin he had wrought, and his
master cried, “The man is quite mad! Take him
away!”</p>

<p>“Not so, my master, I am not mad,” Genzaburo
replied. “I did this thing with reason. Take all my
fingers if you wish, or even my life if the commands of
your honorable ancestors must be carried out. But
I shall have the happiness of knowing that no more
little maids can be frightened and mutilated by your
cruelty.”</p>

<p>The nobleman gazed upon him in silence; but the
son threw himself before his father.</p>

<p>“I beg you, oh my father, forgive this mad fellow,”
he cried. “I too am in fault, for I persuaded you to
give this entertainment in the hope that she would
break a plate and then turn to me in her trouble.”</p>

<p>Then O Cho San knelt before him and said, “Honorable
Master, since I am the occasion of this great
trouble in your household, I beg you to permit me to go
away and be not angry with either your son or your
servant. Forgive them, and of your graciousness allow
me to depart, since my only wish is to work for the
welfare of my dear mother.”</p>

<p>Then was the nobleman greatly touched. Mindful
of Genzaburo’s long service, he forgave him. He forgave
his son, also; for since O Cho San loved him not,
he needed no further punishment. Mindful still more
of O Cho San’s pleasant services in his household, he
said, “We will speak no more of the porcelain plates of
my ancestors. O Cho San will not leave me. She shall
continue to live in my service and her wages shall be
increased.”</p>

<p>Then he gave her a reward, and she lived many years
and earned much <i>yen</i> for the welfare of her dear mother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FISHES_OF_THE_BOILING_SPRING">THE FISHES OF THE BOILING SPRING</h2>
</div>


<p>Many, many years ago there lived at Atami a holy
priest. Of all the poor people of the village, he was
the very poorest, for he gave away nearly all that was
given to him; and he was often hungry.</p>

<p>Atami was by the sea and the people lived on the
sea’s bounty. When the winter swept down from
Fuji San, and the storm god roared on the waves and
frightened the fish away, then all the people hungered.
The fathers and mothers hungered greatly, for they
gave nearly all there was to the children, who were not,
therefore, so much in want. But the priest hungered
most of all; for he was the father of his people, and so
gave them of his own share of food. Indeed, he gave
them more than this; for, under the camphor tree
which grew beside his little temple on the hill, he sat
and prayed for his people, and the gods heard his
prayers.</p>

<p>One day the fish were gone from the shore and the
people were very hungry. The priest of Atami sat and
prayed, and lo! the camphor tree opened, and there
appeared to him a lovely goddess in a mantle of purple.
Her face was fair and kind, but her eyes gleamed with
displeasure, and she said, “Sit not here and pray for
fish, oh foolish one! Even now the fish are upon your
shore; behold them!” Then the tree closed and he
saw her no more.</p>

<p>The priest was afraid and hastened to the shore;
and there he saw a terrible sight and smelled a terrible
smell.</p>

<p>The whole beach was covered with fishes. There
were big fishes and little fishes, long fishes and fat
fishes, and strange fishes that no one had ever seen
before. They would have fed the village for many
days, but alas! each fish was scalded as by fire and
was crumbling into bits.</p>

<p>The good priest wept as if his heart would break,
crying aloud, “Alas, my people, my people!”</p>

<p>Then he climbed high upon the hill above the village,
and looked over the sea, hoping that he might
learn what had caused the fish to die. There he prayed
to the gods, “Open my eyes that I may see, and aid
my people.”</p>

<p>Far out at sea, and under the surface of the water,
he beheld a great turmoil. The waters boiled and
bubbled as if in torment. And through the waters,
the fishes leaped, and lo! they were scalded to death.</p>

<p>The priest called to the watchman, who stood upon
the hill to tell the people when good fish came to the
shore, “Haste! haste!” he said, “run to the temple
and bring me a branch from the holy camphor tree
which grows beside it. For thy life, haste!”</p>

<p>The watchman, being young, made great haste.
Soon he brought back a bough of the tree. Its leaves
were like green jade and it was of more avail than
many demons.</p>

<p>Then the priest prayed upon the shore, while he
waved his camphor branch in the air, “Oh Kwan-on,
Goddess of Mercy,” he said, “look upon our distress
and have pity upon my people. Give us fish lest we
die. And cause the turmoil in the sea to cease.”</p>

<p>He threw the sacred bough far from him into the
sea. Then there came a mighty rumbling, and the
crest of the hill rose into a cone, and through it the
waters burst, rising toward heaven in a stream so
high that it seemed to reach the clouds.</p>

<p>Soon the people came with speed and made channels
in the earth. The hot water flowed into the channels,
and all who bathed therein were cured of their ailments;
and the place was called the “Spring of Kindness.”</p>

<p>Then was the old priest much rejoiced, for the fish
came back to his people, and there was food to eat.
He dwelt long in the shrine on the hilltop, and his
people were grateful to him, and made him many
offerings.</p>

<p>And to this day the camphor tree grows, with its
small, pointed, green-jade leaves, old, and strong, and
fragrant, upon the hill of Atami.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INAO_OF_THE_AINU">THE INAO OF THE AINU</h2>
</div>


<p>In the beginning of things the world was very hot.
The mountains breathed fire and smoke, even the
snows were melted and the sun goddess shone fiercely,
with a cruel light. She scorched the food of the people,
and withered their flowers and trees.</p>

<p>But Okikurumi, a mighty fisherman, saw the sorrows
of the Ainu and grieved. He was of a kind heart,
and all the people loved him. He was tall and straight
as a young bamboo, of gentle mien and thoughtful,
wise for the safety of the Ainu whom he loved.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the land was scorched with the heat,
and folk were starving, Okikurumi caught many fish
and sent them to the Ainu by his wife.</p>

<p>She was named Tureshi, and she lived but to do the
will of her lord.</p>

<p>“Go thou to the Ainu,” he said, “take this basket
of fish. Put it in at the window of the chief man of
the village and hasten back. I forbid the Ainu to
question you or to look at you. Go!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” Tureshi answered; and she girdled
her kimono about her and started upon her errand.</p>

<div class="section fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="i150" style="max-width: 68em;">

</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Day after day she went to the aid of the suffering
people. But they saw her not, for Okikurumi had
commanded them to refrain from gazing upon the face
of his wife.</p>

<p>At last, however, one man grew curious. He wished
to see this forbidden being. “She is either the most
beautiful person in the world or else she is so ugly
that her husband feels shame to have her seen of other
men,” he said to himself. “In any case I will find out.”</p>

<p>Thus he spoke, being of an evil nature and all unmindful
of the benefits of Okikurumi. When Tureshi
came to the window, therefore, he lay in wait, while
Kusa-Hitari<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> sang in the night. Catching Tureshi by
the hand he drew her into the house, and gazed upon
her lovely face. For she was the most beautiful of
women, her husband’s joy and pride. Then, she in
great alarm fled from the Ainu to her husband’s side,
crying out to Okikurumi, “My lord, I have obeyed
you, but send me not again to these ungrateful people
who disobey your commands. Their wretched lives
are not worth the saving.”</p>

<p>Okikurumi was full of wrath and he declared that,
henceforth and forever, the men of the Ainu should
find food for their own women, since Tureshi could not
go to them without insult.</p>

<p>Then were the men of the Ainu very sad, and many
of them died and their chief men mourned.</p>

<p>So they took an <i>inao</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and set it up upon the sea
shore. Its staff was straight and slender, and its curls
and tassels floated free in the gentle breeze. By this
they meant to worship the spirit of the sea and implore
him to bring them good fortune.</p>

<p>Then the sea spirit, who loved not Okikurumi, was
pleased with the <i>inao</i> and sent them many fish.</p>

<p>But again there came a famine to the land of the
Ainu, and it was worse than any that had gone before.
The children hungered, and the mothers wept, and
the old men set up an <i>inao</i>; but all was of no avail.
At last they sought a wise man, and he gave them
good counsel, saying, “Gather together all the crumbs
which are left in the village, millet and rice malt, and
make a little cup of wine.” This they did.</p>

<p>“Pour it into six cups of lacquer,” he said, and this
they did. And the scent of the <i>saké</i> rose upward, even
unto heaven, and it was good.</p>

<p>The gods hastened from far and near to see whence
came the delicious smell. They drank of the <i>saké</i> and
it was very good. Then they danced and sang and
laughed in glee. And as they danced, one goddess
pulled out two hairs from a deer and cast them far
away, and lo! from the mountains came two herds of
deer. Then another goddess plucked two scales from
a fish and threw them far into the river, and behold,
shoals of fish swam from the sea.</p>

<p>Then were the Ainu much rejoiced, and men went
proudly forth upon the mountains to hunt the deer;
and others sought the river and caught many fish.
And from that day there was always fish and flesh in
the land of the Ainu, and there was no more famine.</p>

<p>A Samurai dwelt in the Oni province and his name
was Satsuma Shichizaemon. He had a garden, the
most beautiful of any in the village. It was filled
with flowering plants, and the shrubs had a delicious
fragrance which filled the air. Golden-hearted lilies
floated upon the tiny lake, dwarf pines waved their
branches over the water’s edge, and above all, dark
and silent, towered a huge <i>enoki</i>, or goblin tree.</p>

<p>This tree had stood there for centuries, and no one
had dared to cut a branch or even to pull one of its
leaves.</p>

<p>Shichizaemon, however, was of a bad heart, and
had no reverence for the things of his fathers. He
wished the view from his window not to be hidden,
and the <i>enoki</i> stood between him and the valley. So
he gave orders to have the tree cut down.</p>

<p>That night his mother dreamed a dream. She saw
before her a terrible dragon-like monster whose forked
tongue spit fire, and who said to her, “Mother of
Satsuma Shichizaemon, beware! Your son shall die
and all his house if he harm the <i>enoki</i>, for the
spirits of the trees will not suffer insult to the goblin
tree.”</p>

<p>Next day she told her son of her dream, but he only
laughed at her, and said, “If all the spirits of the
earth and air and water were to come to you in dreams,
still I should make way with this tree.” Then he sent
a woodman to cut down the tree.</p>

<p>As the tall tree fell with a crash so loud as to frighten
all the household, Satsuma also fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“I am ill!” he cried. “The tree! The tree!” and
he knew no more; for he was dead. Soon too his wife
fell ill, and then his mother. Within a month there
remained not one of all his people. Even the servants
disappeared from earth, all crying as their spirits
departed, “A-a-e-e-e-i! The tree! The tree!”</p>

<p>Long the dwelling was left deserted. Stagnant
waterweeds fouled the lake, and even the songs of
the birds seemed mournful and sad. At last it was
remembered that there remained of the family of
Satsuma but one person, a nun named Tikem, who
dwelt in the temple at Yamashira. They sent to her
saying, “O Tikem San, will you not come to the garden
of your kinsman, and remove the terrible curse
which rests upon it?”</p>

<p>“I will come,” she answered.</p>

<p>She came to the dwelling of Satsuma Shichizaemon,
her kinsman, and all the people in the village watched
in fear, lest the sickness of the goblin tree should come
upon her. But O Tikem San feared not.</p>

<p>She abode in the house calmly attending to her
duties, and she was well. Every day she went to the
place where had stood the goblin tree, and there she
offered up prayers for the kinsman who had perished.
And there was no more curse, for the holiness of O
Tikem San rested upon the place like a gentle breath
from heaven. And all the children of the village
played happily in the sunlit garden where once had
been the goblin tree.</p>

<p>There was once a hunter who shot a great bear,
and the beast ran from him and entered a cave.</p>

<p>“I will go after it,” the hunter said to himself, “for,
since it is wounded, it will be easy to kill it when it is
trapped in the cave.”</p>

<p>So he went into the cave, but could find no bear.
He saw its tracks, and they led down a dark passage
which seemed to slope into the earth. He followed
this passage a long way, but found no bear. Suddenly
he came into an open space and saw before him a
beautiful garden. It was filled with wonderful trees
such as he had never before seen, and some of them
bore strange fruits.</p>

<p>Now as there was no one to forbid, he plucked some
berries and found that they were good. But suddenly
he was overcome with a strange feeling, and gazing
down upon himself, he saw that he was turned into a
horrible serpent. Struck with terror, he cried, “What
fearful thing has befallen me? I who was a man,
ruler over all animals, even the four-footed kings of
the forest, am become the lowest of the low, even a
loathsome serpent.” He hung his head in shame, and
crawled back through the cave, and lay down at the
foot of a huge pine tree.</p>

<p>Wearied and distressed, at last he fell asleep and
dreamed a dream. In his dream a woman appeared
to him, who looked kindly upon him and said, “I feel
sorrow for you, unhappy youth. I am the spirit of the
pine tree, and you may hear me speak when the wind
sweeps from Fuji San and whispers through my pines.
This thing has happened to you because you ate the
fruit of Fengtu,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of which no man may eat in safety.
But you can be saved if you will obey me. Climb
to the very topmost branches of this pine and hurl
yourself down to earth. So you may return to your
true self.”</p>

<p>The hunter awoke and, remembering his dream,
said, “It would be better to be dashed to pieces than
to remain alive and be a loathsome serpent. I will
throw myself down from the tree and may the gods
help me.”</p>

<p>Gliding carefully up to the very topmost branch,
he poised for a moment, and then gave a mighty leap.
He fell to the ground and for a long time he knew no
more.</p>

<p>When he returned to himself, he stood at the foot
of the great pine tree beside the crushed body of a
huge serpent, and his own form was once more the
form of a man. Then was his heart full of a great
thanksgiving, and he straightway set up <i>inao</i> beneath
the kindly pine tree.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LAUGHING_DUMPLING">THE LAUGHING DUMPLING</h2>
</div>


<p>There was once an old woman who laughed at
everything. She was a very old woman, but she seemed
young. That was because she laughed so much, for
the god of laughter made all the lines in her face
pleasant lines.</p>

<p>She laughed at rain, she laughed at drought, she
laughed at poverty. She had never had a chance to
laugh at wealth, for she was very, very poor. She
made rice dumplings to sell, and so she was called
by the people about her the “Laughing Dumpling.”
Her name was really Sanja.</p>

<p>Sanja had but one wish. She never prayed to
Juro-Jin<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> for good fortune, or to any of the gods for
wealth; but she wished above all things to make the
finest rice dumplings in all the city. She tried and
tried, and each time she made them better than the
last; but she never made them quite perfect, and so
she was never quite satisfied. She never had quite all
the rice she wanted to work with; for she was so poor
that each grain seemed to her as dear as a piece of
money to a miser.</p>

<p>But still she tried and still she laughed. One day
she sat in her kitchen making her dumplings with her
usual care. Her little house stood at the top of a hill,
quite outside of the city, and as she worked and patted
with her paddle, one of the finest of her dumplings,
it slipped and rolled right out of the door and down
the hill.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear!” she cried, “that will never, never
do! I can’t afford to lose that dumpling. Perhaps I
can catch it.”</p>

<p>So she sprang up and ran after it as fast as her feet
would carry her. But the dumpling had a good start,
and she could not catch it. She saw it ahead of her,
and suddenly it bounced down a hole in the ground.
She ran after it, and before she knew it, her <i>geta</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
slipped into the hole and she dropped through.</p>

<p>“A-a-a-i!” she cried, “where am I going?”</p>

<p>She did not stop falling until her breath was almost
gone. Then suddenly she found herself in a place she
had never seen before. The trees and flowers looked
strange, and she felt a little frightened and very much
alone. But as she looked about her her heart grew
lighter, for she saw a statue of Jizu and him she well
knew. So she bowed to him, and said, “Good morning,
my Lord Jizu. Have you seen a rice dumpling
fall this way?”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” answered Jizu, with his very
sweet smile. “Yes, I saw a dumpling and it went
past here, down the hill, skipping as if it had legs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you very much, then I must skip after
it,” said Sanja.</p>

<p>“Not so,” answered Jizu, “do not go down there.
An <i>Oni</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> lives there, and he may do you harm.”</p>

<p>“But I must have my dumpling,” laughed the old
woman; and she ran on in the direction the dumpling
had taken. She had gone only a little way when she
came to another statue of Jizu. Being a good woman
as well as polite, she bowed to it very reverently, and
said, “My good Lord Jizu, have you seen a dumpling
pass this way?”</p>

<p>“As if it had wings, it flew past me,” said Jizu,
smiling upon her most sweetly.</p>

<p>“Then I must hurry to catch it,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>But Jizu shook his head, “You must not think of
that,” he said, “there is an Oni below there who is
most wicked. He does not like old women at all, and
he will surely be cruel to you if he does not eat
you.”</p>

<p>“But I must have my dumpling,” said Sanja.
“He’ll not eat me. I’m too tough. Tee-hee-hee!”
and she ran laughing on her way.</p>

<p>As she went along she thought she smelled her
dumpling, and, as she was very hungry, it smelled
very good.</p>

<p>“If I ever catch that dumpling I will certainly eat
every bit of it,” she said to herself. “I will punish it
for giving me such a chase. Tee-hee-hee!” Then she
felt a shadow across her face. She looked up and saw
another statue of Jizu.</p>

<p>“Most gracious Lord Jizu,” she said, smiling up into
his ever smiling face, “have you seen my dumpling
pass this way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it passed but a moment ago,” he answered,
“but do not think of searching for it, for the Oni who
lives beyond is very fierce and cruel, and he will certainly
eat you. He is fond of dumplings, but he is
much fonder of human meat.”</p>

<p>“One who is as old as I am hasn’t any very fresh
meat on her bones, tee-hee-hee!” laughed Sanja.
But as she spoke, she heard a terrible noise and her
face turned pale.</p>

<p>“Get behind me quickly,” said Jizu, “here comes
the Oni. Perhaps you may escape him if you hide
behind me.”</p>

<p>O Sanja San crept quickly behind him. She found
herself not so brave as she had thought, and she did
not feel at all like laughing. She hid herself very carefully
behind Jizu, and up came the Oni, very wild
and fierce.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Lord Jizu,” he said, “I smell meat!”</p>

<p>Even for the Oni, Jizu’s smile was the same, and he
made answer, “Good morning, Oni. Is it not dumpling
that you smell? I saw one pass this way not long
ago.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said the Oni, “it is not dumpling.
I know one passed this way, for I saw it. What I
smell now is human meat!” and he sniffed and sniffed
until Sanja shivered. But for all her fear, she wanted
very much to laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t smell it,” said Jizu, still smiling. “Are
you sure it is not rice dumpling? It seems to me that
I smell a little of it about you.”</p>

<p>“That is not strange,” said the Oni with a grin;
“for when I saw that juicy dumpling rolling my way
I caught it and ate it. It was good. I wish I had the
person who made it!”</p>

<p>O Sanja San was as angry as she could be at the
thought of his eating her dumpling. She was frightened,
too, and she cowered closer in the shadow of the
Lord Jizu.</p>

<p>“What I smell now is meat, fresh human meat,
juicy, young and tender!” and the Oni sniffed again
and smacked his lips very impolitely.</p>

<p>This was too much for Sanja. She could not help
thinking of her wrinkled, withered flesh, and how far
from juicy, young and tender it was. She laughed out
loud, “Tee-hee-hee. Tee-hee-hee!”</p>

<p>The Oni’s ears were as good as his nose, and without
a word he stretched out a long, hairy arm behind
Jizu, and pulled her forth from her hiding place. She
was frightened terribly, but still she laughed.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded the Oni.</p>

<p>“I am the woman who made the dumpling,” she
answered. “Why did you eat it?”</p>

<p>“Because it was good,” said the Oni.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t eat me for that reason,” said Sanja.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to eat you,” said the Oni. “You
will come home with me and cook. You needn’t be
afraid. As long as you cook good dumplings for me
nothing will harm you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Sanja politely, for there was really
nothing else to say.</p>

<p>The Oni put her in a boat and rowed away across
a river to his castle. There she cooked for him such
dishes as he had never before tasted, and they were
good.</p>

<p>But when she came to make rice dumplings, the
Oni said to her, “You are a good cook, but you are
wasteful. When you cook rice put but one grain
into the pot.”</p>

<p>“One grain!” she cried. “Tee-hee-hee! how could
any one live on one grain of rice?”</p>

<p>“I will show you,” said the Oni. “For though you
are a woman and think you know much, there are
some things which I know better than you.”</p>

<p>Sanja was silent; but she tossed her head a little,
and said to herself, “How impolite he is! And how
vain to think he could possibly know more than I do!”</p>

<p>“Be sure you have your water boiling,” said the
Oni. “Put one grain of rice in the pot, then take
this paddle in your hand and if you want rice for ten
persons stir ten times, in this way;” and he stirred
the paddle about in the water. “See!” and lo! the
grain of rice burst into ten pieces, and each piece into
ten more, and each a perfect grain, until the pot was
filled.</p>

<p>Sanja fairly gasped with astonishment.</p>

<p>“This is a magic paddle,” said the Oni; “and with
it you can cook every thing, serve every one, and always
have enough.”</p>

<p>So Sanja stayed with the Oni and cooked for him,
and she gave perfect satisfaction. The dumplings she
made were always perfect, and the rice pot was never
empty, because of the magic paddle.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>All went very well until one day Sanja grew homesick.
She felt as if she could not stay with the Oni
another day, and as if she would die if she could not
go home. She thought and thought about it; and the
little hut with its paper walls, and the cherry tree
beside it seemed fairer than all the fine castles of Oni
Land. So, one day when the Oni had gone off for a
day’s hunting, she decided to try to escape. She stole
out of the castle and down to the river’s bank; and
there she found the boat in which the Oni had brought
her. Quickly she got into it and began to row. She
had reached the middle of the river, when she heard
a loud cry from the shore. There was the Oni with
all his friends, waving their hands wildly and calling
loudly to her, “Come back, Laughing Dumpling, come
back!”</p>

<p>She was afraid to go on and still more afraid to go
back. She began to row harder than ever when she
saw what the Oni was doing. He and all his friends
stooped down and, making cups of their hands, they
began to drink the water of the river. They drank
and drank, and soon there was so little water left to
float the boat that they could wade to her across the
river bed. She was so frightened that she could hardly
think. As they came nearer, however, she thought
how funny they looked, wading out from the reedy
shore, and she laughed, “Tee-hee-hee!”</p>

<p>The Oni stopped and looked at her, “How strange
that she laughs at everything!” said one.</p>

<p>She laughed again, “Tee-hee-hee!”</p>

<p>“She shall not laugh at me!” cried her master; and
he started fiercely toward her.</p>

<p>The Laughing Dumpling was not going to be caught
if she could help it, for she felt that this was now no
laughing matter. Wondering what she could do to
get away, she thought of the magic paddle which was
tucked in her belt, where she had always carried it.
She drew it forth, and reaching over the side of the
boat she quickly stirred the waters. Then, lo! they
began to flow again. They flowed so fast that they
washed the boat right into the shore. They filled the
river so quickly that the Oni had to swim for their
lives.</p>

<p>Sanja ran quickly away, as fast as she could go,
past the three statues of Jizu, up the hill and, with
difficulty, up through the very hole into which she had
fallen.</p>

<p>When she reached home she sat down quite exhausted;
but as soon as she could get her breath she
laughed until she cried.</p>

<p>“I ought not to have taken away the Oni’s paddle,”
she said; “but he ate my dumpling, and made me
cook all these months without any pay. Now I shall
be able to make fine dumplings for all Kyoto. Tee-hee-hee!”</p>

<p>And so she did. For the magic paddle kept her
always supplied with rice, and everybody came to eat
of the wonderful rice cakes and to see the Laughing
Dumpling.</p>

</div>


<p>Yamato and his army came one day to Lagami,
and then crossing the mountain, they soon arrived at
the Bay of Yedo.</p>

<p>“It will be easy to cross here,” cried the prince to his
men. “The distance is small from one shore to the
other. There is no water here to fear. We can soon
conquer this obstacle.”</p>

<p>Kompira, god of the sea, heard the prince’s boast
and was angry.</p>

<p>“I will show this proud fellow that he can not despise
the least of my children,” he said wrathfully.</p>

<p>Then he blew upon the waves, and they lashed themselves
into foam. They rose toward high heaven, and
dashed against the ships of Yamato Take until they
were beaten upon the rocks and nearly overwhelmed.
There arose, also, a fearful storm; the lightnings flashed
about the ships, and the thunder roared, and all were
sore afraid.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Kompira, “I wonder if these
mortals now see my power! They may well fear me,
Kompira, the god of the sea!”</p>

<p>Yamato Take was sad. He gazed in the face of ruin.</p>

<p>“Behold,” he sighed. “This is the end of all my
struggles. My ships will be dashed to pieces upon the
rocks. We shall all perish in the sea or be taken
prisoners by the enemy. The wrath of Kompira,
great god of the sea, is turned against me, for I have
offended him. There is no more hope.”</p>

<p>Then he laid his hand upon his second<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> sword; but
his wife stayed his hand.</p>

<p>“Not so, my lord,” she cried, raising her beautiful
pale face toward his. She loved him and was always
with him, in peace or war.</p>

<p>She was very lovely, the Princess Ota Tachabana;
and Yamato Take listened when she spoke.</p>

<p>“Not so, my dear lord,” she spoke again. “Victory
shall be yours. We have but to appease the wrath of
Kompira and all will be well. I, myself, will be the
sacrifice needed for your dear safety.”</p>

<p>With that she raised both her hands to the sea and
prayed, “O Kompira, great god of the sea, be not
angry with my lord, for he is good. Send him a fortunate
issue, and accept my sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Thus crying, she stood poised for a moment upon
the prow of the ship, and then sprang into the sea.</p>

<p>Yamato gave a terrible cry and would have followed
her, but his chief men laid hands upon him and would
not let him go.</p>

<p>The wind sank to quietness, the waves grew calm,
the storm ceased, and his headman cried, “My lord,
the sacrifice is accepted. We may now pass quickly
in safety. Because she would wish it, rouse yourself
to strife and conquest.”</p>

<p>When morning broke, the ships were safely moored
by the farther shore. As Yamato stepped out upon
the sand, the lapping waves cast at his feet the comb
of the princess, his wife. He picked it up and commanded
that at that spot a temple should be raised to
her memory.</p>

<p>Then he made a great conquest for his lord the
emperor, and his soldiers boasted of him and said,
“He is the greatest warrior in the world, the Prince
Yamato Take!”</p>

<p>But he was no longer proud. Instead, when men
praised him, and honors were showered upon him,
he bent his head and said only, “Azuma! azuma! wa

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TWO_BROTHERS">THE TWO BROTHERS</h2>
</div>


<p>There were once two brothers who were as different
as day and night. The oldest, Kurobei, cared only
for himself and thought of nothing but of what might
advance his own interests. Moreover, he was very
proud and haughty. The younger brother’s name was
Kazuma. He was gentle and of a kind heart, and all
the people loved him.</p>

<p>When therefore the father died, and the two brothers
were left alone in the world (their mother having been
dead for many years), there were those among the servants
who said, “It is a pity that O Kazuma is not the
elder, to rule the house; for his rule would be one of
kindness.”</p>

<p>Both Kurobei and Kazuma loved their father and
had been dutiful sons. Both had obeyed the old man
and both had grieved at his death. They had him
buried with every token of respect and they wept at
his loss.</p>

<p>“My father is no more,” cried Kurobei. “I must
place offerings upon his grave that all men may see
that I hold him in respectful remembrance.”</p>

<p>But the younger brother wept most bitterly. “Alas!
alas!” he cried. “My father is gone from me! No
longer may we go to him each day and ask his advice
upon the many things which trouble us! How shall
we live? Let us each day place upon his grave flowers
of remembrance. Perhaps his spirit may some day
speak with us.”</p>

<p>Kurobei agreed to this and each morning the two
brothers could be seen bearing flowers to their father’s
grave, and there they talked to their father, telling him
of all the doings of their lives.</p>

<p>And all the people saw and said, “How good Kurobei
is! Though he has much to do, in the affairs of his
home, still each day he takes his brother with him and
goes to his father’s grave, lest the younger forget his
filial piety.”</p>

<p>Thus things went on for twelve months, and the
matter coming to the emperor’s ears, he appointed
Kurobei to a high place in his household, saying, “One
who so well serves his father will be faithful in office.”
And Kazuma was much pleased at the honor shown
to his brother, whom he dearly loved.</p>

<p>Kurobei went much to the palace and much enjoyed
his new life. He said to Kazuma, “You will see now
that you must go alone to my father’s grave, good
brother, for I am much occupied with affairs. For the
honor of the family I must appear well at court, and
my father would wish it. I have gone to his grave daily
these twelve months and never omitted this respect;
but now my duty to the emperor demands that the rest
of my time be spent at the palace. Go you therefore
to the grave, if you will, since you have no higher duty.”</p>

<p>“But my brother!” cried Kazuma in astonishment.
“Will you neglect our father’s grave altogether?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied the elder brother. “Be not so
hasty in your judgments, for that is a sin. I shall place
before his grave the day lily which shall bloom daily,
and thus shall I continue to do him honor. I have
chosen a handsome plant, and shall pay a gardener
well to tend it for me. The flowers shall stand in my
stead before the grave, and I shall have leisure to attend
to my duties at the palace, coming to visit my father
only upon the days of special fête.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my brother,” cried Kazuma. “Plant not the
lily of forgetfulness!”</p>

<p>Kurobei only said, “Trouble me no further, I have
spoken.”</p>

<p>Then Kazuma spoke no more, but he went even
more carefully each day to his father’s grave and there
he made offerings. He talked to the spirit of his beloved
father, and told him all things which occurred to
him each day.</p>

<p>The elder brother at first went upon the feast days,
but as time passed he went less and less, and at last he
went not even upon the Feast of the Dead, when every
one should remember their dead with incense and a
bower of bamboo and bright berries.</p>

<p>This made Kazuma very sad, and at last he spoke.</p>

<p>“O Kurobei,” he said, “honorable brother, have you
quite forgotten our father? You never visit his grave.”</p>

<p>Kurobei was angry and spoke harshly. “Why do
you bother me, troublesome fellow? Did I not tell
you I had no time to attend to it? I planted the lily,
and I pay the gardener to attend to it; I can not do more
for my duty lies elsewhere. Does not the lily fare well?”</p>

<p>“It fares well, my brother,” said Kazuma sadly; and
to himself he whispered, “the lily of forgetfulness.”</p>

<p>Then after his brother had gone to the palace he
wept much and said, “My brother’s heart has grown
like a stone. He has forgotten my father and all that
he has for him is the lily of forgetfulness. I too shall
plant a flower, but mine shall be the aster for memory;
for I shall never, never, forget my honorable father.
Each day I will tend the aster with my own hands;
for it is a sacred flower, the flower of remembrance.”</p>

<p>Then he did as he said, and every day he tended the
plants and prayed beside his father’s grave. And every
day he loved his father more and more.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“EVERY DAY HE TENDED THE PLANTS”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>One day when he was tending the flower he heard
a strange sound. He listened and there seemed to come
from the grave a whispering voice. It said to him,
“O Kazuma, I am sent to guard the spirit of your
honorable father. Long have you remembered your
parent when your brother had forgotten him. You
have planted for him the sacred asters of remembrance,
and here they have bloomed in purple beauty. All
these things I have noticed and I am well pleased with
your filial piety. So, fear me not, faithful son. To
you I shall be a spirit of kindness so long as you live.
I can read the future, and ever I shall whisper to you
in dreams of the night, and I shall direct you in the
paths which you should follow to meet success. Farewell!”</p>

<p>The voice ceased and Kazuma stood amazed before
the asters and the day lilies of his brother. He returned
home greatly wondering, and told his wife all that had
happened.</p>

<p>That night, in sleep, the spirit came to him and told
him all that he should do to meet success; and when
day came he obeyed the voice, and all was well with
him. And so it continued, for success waited upon him
at every turn, and his wife bore him many sons and all
his life he was happy and fortunate.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PRINCESS_AND_THE_FOX_BABY">THE PRINCESS AND THE FOX BABY</h2>
</div>


<p>A little princess sat beneath the cherry blooms
in the royal garden. It was spring and the whole garden
was a mass of radiant pink bloom, as soft as the sunset
glow on the snows of Fuji San.</p>

<p>The little princess was as fair as the cherry blooms,
and the petals had drifted lovingly upon her. They had
powdered the ground about her like snowflakes, and
rested upon her soft black hair like a coronet of pearl.</p>

<p>As she sat and dreamed in the sunshine, the little
princess was very happy, and she said to herself, “What
a beautiful world this is! I wish every one was as happy
as I am!” This she said because her heart was as kind
as her face was fair.</p>

<p>Then she heard a sudden rush and the patter of tiny
feet, and a little baby fox sprang over the garden wall
and ran right under the princess’s robe. She stooped
and took it in her arms.</p>

<p>“Poor little frightened foxling,” she said. “What
is the matter?”</p>

<p>But the little fox only tucked his sharp nose under
her arm and trembled all over.</p>

<p>Then the princess heard a shout and looking up, she
saw some boys on the wall.</p>

<p>“That is our fox,” they cried roughly, for they did
not know she was a princess. “Give it to us!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Kill it and eat the flesh for supper,” cried the biggest
boy. “Then we will sell the skin, and the liver can
be sold to the magician doctor who cures fever with it.
We shall get many <i>bu</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> for the fox, and we can buy rice
cakes and other things.”</p>

<p>The little fox seemed to understand, for he cowered
closer to the princess. He poked his nose into the palm
of her hand and kissed it gently.</p>

<p>“You may have the price of the foxling, but you may
not have his life, poor baby,” said the little princess.
“Here,” she pulled her purse from her kimono sleeve—“here
is a gold piece for the flesh, and one for the liver,
one for the fur, and still another for the life of this poor
little bundle of fur. And pray the gods to give you
kinder hearts in your breasts, for neither the gods nor
men like cruel souls.”</p>

<p>The boys quickly took the gold which she offered
them, lest she should change her mind and take back
the coins, but she had no thought of doing that.
Gold was nothing to her, because of it she had
plenty; but the life of the fox baby seemed very
precious.</p>

<p>“Fox Baby,” she said as she untied a string from his
neck. “Where are your father and mother?” The
fox gave a sad little whine, and its eyes seemed full of
tears. From a bamboo thicket nearby came some
short, sharp barks. The fox baby barked in return,
and the princess saw peering from between the bamboo
branches two old foxes who looked anxiously at the
baby.</p>

<p>“Really I believe these are your parents, foxling,”
she said. “I shall let you go to them. I would like
to keep you for my playmate, you are so soft and pretty;
but you would be lonely, no matter how much I loved
you, and I never could be as your father and mother.
So run along and be happy.”</p>

<p>She stroked him gently and set him down, and with
great leaps he was off to the bamboo thicket. Then
the princess watched with pleasure, for the old foxes
received him with joy; they licked him over and over,
and then, one on either side the baby fox, they trotted
happily away. The princess smiled ’neath the cherry
blooms and was glad.</p>

<p>Summer bloomed and the lotus lay golden hearted
on the waters’ brim. It passed and the maples were
scarlet and gold upon the hillsides. The sun was a
glory of burnished gold in the heavens, but within the
palace all was dark.</p>

<p>The little princess walked no more in the garden.
She lay parched with fever upon her slumber mat and
her mother and father watched beside her day and
night. All the wise doctors in the land had been called
to her side.</p>

<p>“She can not live,” they said, “since sleep does not
visit her eyelids.” They tried by every means to make
her sleep, but though her eyelids were heavy and she
longed for slumber, it came not, and every day she grew
weaker.</p>

<p>At last came the emperor’s magician and he gazed
upon her long and carefully. At last he said, “She is
cast under a spell. Unless the spell is broken she must
die. One must sit beside her from the going down of
the sun until it rises again in golden splendor from behind
the mountains. That one will break the charm.”</p>

<p>“That is easy,” cried the princess’s maids. “We will
watch to-night and save her;” for the little princess was
so sweet and good that every one loved her. But lo!
when the midnight came, the maidens felt a strange
charm steal over them, and a strange scent was wafted
to them, and strange music filled their ears, and they
slept.</p>

<p>When morning came they wept and felt very sad;
for the princess was weaker and they had not broken
the charm.</p>

<p>The princess’s old nurse was very angry.</p>

<p>“Foolish ones,” she cried. “You have idled and
slept and my darling is not yet well. I will watch to-night,
for she grows weaker each day.”</p>

<p>But alas! the old nurse was no more fortunate than
the maidens, for the spell was woven about her also and
she slept; and when she awoke, she, too, wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Then all manner of people tried to withstand the
charm and watch with the sick maiden, and even the
little princess’s father and mother, but to no avail.
And daily she grew weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>At last there came to the palace a young warrior,
Ito San, who begged to be allowed to watch one night.</p>

<p>“I love the princess,” he said. “Rather than sleep
I shall die.” Then he took his sword, keen and sharp,
and placing the point beneath his chin, rested the handle
upon the floor. Each time his head drooped in sleep,
the point would bite and sting, and, struggling with the
drowsiness which overtook him, he would sit upright
again. In this way he conquered sleep.</p>

<p>When the princess opened her eyes she seemed less
weak, and Ito gazed upon her with love in his eyes.
Then sleepily, she smiled upon him, and at last she
slept.</p>

<p>He sat beside her until morning not daring to
move.</p>

<p>As the sunrise swept over the land, turning all to glowing
beauty, he heard a strange, weird chant; and the
words of it were stranger still, for the voice sang,</p>

    <div class="verse indentq">“Serve to the little princess</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“A fox’s liver,” cried the young warrior joyously.
“My beloved, now shall you be saved!” He repeated
the song of the sunrise to the mother of the princess and
she told the emperor. Then he sent far and wide to
all the great hunters of the hills.</p>

<p>“Bring us the liver of a fox,” he commanded, “a
clean and healthy fox. Do this as quickly as possible,
for my daughter is sick unto death.”</p>

<p>The hunters sought on every hill and in every valley,
through every tangled wildwood and over every moor,
but they found no fox.</p>

<p>“There are no foxes!” they cried to the emperor.
“We have searched far and near, and not one is to be
found.”</p>

<p>Then the young warrior said, “I will find one. There
must be a fox somewhere in the wildwood for this
gentle little heart who loved all animals.”</p>

<p>Then Ito San hunted far and wide, but he found no
foxes; for the cunning animals had heard the proclamation
of the emperor and had hidden themselves.
So Ito San returned to the palace with grief in his heart,
ready to slay himself in his despair.</p>

<p>At that moment he felt a hand touch his sleeve, and
turning quickly he saw a little old woman, with a queer
little pointed face, and a mantle of red fur wrapped
about her. In her hand she bore a jar, and she said,
“Take this quickly and the princess will be well.”</p>

<p>“What is the price?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she burst into tears. “The price is more
than you could ever pay, but the princess paid it long
ago. Hasten to her!”</p>

<p>Then Ito saw that the jar contained fox’s liver and
his heart bounded for joy. He hurried to the palace,
the words of the song in his ears.</p>

<p>They gave her the broth of rice with the liver grated
into it, and lo! she was well. And as she lay dreaming
happily of Ito San and his great love for her, there came
to her in her dream, a fox cub who said, “Dear Princess,
I am that little fox you saved long ago from the cruel
boys. My father and mother were not ungrateful. So
my father gave you his liver to make you well, and my
mother, who would not live without him, sends her red
fur to keep you warm. And this is because you were
kind to the little foxling who was their baby.”</p>

<p>Then the princess awoke, and upon the sleeping mat
there lay, soft and warm and light, the skin of a red fox.</p>
